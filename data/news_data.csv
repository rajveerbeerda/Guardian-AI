About seven months ago, Reddy took Rs 3 lakh from Zameel by promising to secure him some land deals,” the DCP said.However, Zameel later found out that, Reddy, got those deals finalised to other clients and made a handsome amount as commission. “When Zameel demanded Reddy to return his Rs 3 lakh, the latter refused to do so. Enraged, Zameel along with some of his associates trespassed into Reddy’s plot in Hafeezpet and wrote his name as the owner on the compound wall. Reddy then lodged a complaint against Zameel at Miyapur PS,” Gachibowli inspector R Srinivas said.Zameel then decided to eliminate Reddy and hatched a plan with other accused by offering money. Ravi called Reddy to Hyderabad. After Reddy reached Hafeezpet on November 22 to meet Ravi, the latter did not answer his phone calls. “After waiting for a while, Reddy started on a bike towards Kondapur. Ravi along with Azhar and Ismail, kept a watch on him and informed Zameel and Shabbir, who intercepted Reddy and stabbed him, the DCP said.	Ghaziabad: Four persons were arrested on Tuesday night for allegedly shooting dead a 45-year-old woman from point-blank range in Loni area on December 5.The woman’s nephew and his three friends had murdered her over a property dispute, said police.

He also had the power of attorney of the property, but Indra was pressurising him to vacate it so that she could sell it.”Arvind said he was infuriated with Indra’s behaviour and planned to kill her.Harish was also nursing a grudge against the deceased as she had taken Rs 30,000 from him on the assurance of providing him with a job, but apparently she did not fulfil her promise.“Arvind was aware of Indra’s visit to Seema’s house and he had made a WhatsApp call to Harish to tell about her location. During questioning, none of the accused showed any remorse. Investigation revealed that Arvind had promised Rs 5 lakh to Harish and Rohit each in return for the murder . Harish, in turn, had asked Prince to arrange the bike,” the SP added.Jadaun further said, “After the incident, police had investigated the call details of Indra and got the number of another property dealer.

The arrested man, 42-year-old Ram Das, strangled the woman to death using an iron rod at their home in Chhawla as he suspected her of being in a relationship with another man and also because the couple was involved in a property dispute, said Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi).

But he chose to jump parole and did not turn up at the Mandoli jail on May 6. “The Delhi High Court issued a non-bailable warrant against him and the jail authorities announced a reward of R5,000 for information about him,” said the DCP.The local police, meanwhile, had been hunting for parole jumpers in its jurisdiction. “We raided many suspected hideouts, but couldn’t find Kanhaiya. We also visited Haridwar where parole jumpers often hide, but he wasn’t there,” said the DCP.On Saturday, the police received a tip-off that Kanhaiya could visit his house in Sanjay Colony in Okhla. “He owns a house in Sanjay Colony. He planned to sell the house and live in anonymity off the money earned from the sale,” said the DCP.But Kanhaiya’s efforts to sell the house was what gave him away, said another investigator, adding that the word soon reached the local police who nabbed him just as he was about to enter Sanjay Colony.“He had been biding his time by begging on the streets in old Delhi. To avoid being identified, he would mainly take to the streets once it was dark,” said the investigator.	A 49-year-old man wanted for allegedly raping and attempting to kill a minor girl in 2015, was arrested on Saturday, more four years after the incident. Police said the man had fled home to Nepal and was working as a tailor. The man, who was tenant of the girl’s father, had raped the girl after an alleged fight with her father, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa said the incident took on August 10, 2015. It came to light when the mother of the girl, who was six-years-old at the time, went to pick her up from school but was told that girl’s grandfather has already picked her up.“The child’s mother recalled that their tenant, who was familiar with her daughter and addressed him as ‘Dada’ (grandfather), might have picked her up. When she got home, she did not find either the man or her daughter there. The woman searched for her daughter nearby, with the help of her neighbours, and found the child in a nearby green patch in a semi-conscious state,” Randhawa said.The officer said that since the child was injured, she was taken to hospital where doctors confirmed the sexual assault. “It was found that the couple’s tenant, who was the prime suspect, was on the run. Surveillance revealed that the man had fled to his native village in Nepal. In June 2018, court declared the man a proclaimed offender,” he added.He said, while working on unsolved heinous criminal cases, police got a clue that on Saturday, the accused would reach Delhi. “His movements were tracked and he was arrested from near Delhi Gate area in central Delhi,” Randhawa said.During interrogation, the man told police that he and the child’s father are both from Nepal. “He said he used to work at a garment export house in Okhla and often helped the girl’s family with their financial needs. He said the girl’s father had abused him on many occasions, which angered him and he wanted to exact revenge,” the officer said.Randhawa said the accused confessed that on August 10, 2015, he picked up the girl from her school and took her to a jungle area near Sanjay Colony and raped her. He said he even tried to kill the girl but fled, fearing he would be caught. He said, in the past four years he worked as a tailor in Kathmandu and shuttled between Bhutwal and Chaitwan in Nepal to avoid arrest,” he said.

 NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party is in the eye of storm in Jharkhand for inducting a murder accused Shashi Bhushan Mehta, who is currently on bail, into the party on the eve of Assembly elections. Mehta, who was in Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), joined the BJP recently with fanfare, leading to uproar.

Mehta is an accused in the Suchitra Mishra murder case. Her son Abhishek Mishra has now knocked the doors of Home Minister and BJP president Amit Shah, alleging they feared threat to their life and asking him to do ""justice"". The Jharkhand BJP, on the other hand, has defended Mehta's induction, saying he has not been held guilty so far and therefore it should not be made an issue.

Jharkhand is scheduled to go for Assembly elections in November-December and according to sources, the party is planning to give ticket to Mehta from the Panki constituency in Palamau district. While the issue has given fodder to the Opposition Congress, even many BJP leaders have also questioned, though privately, the party leadership's rationale to induct Mehta.

Ruckus erupted at the BJP headquarters during the ""induction ceremony"" of Mehta into the party last week, in the presence of its state unit president Laxman Gilua. Abhishek, his brother Ashutosh and aunt Lalita Pandey were manhandled during the event following which they got injured. The Ranchi Police have not even registered an FIR in the case.

Mehta is the director of Oxford Public School in Ranchi, while Suchitra Mishra worked there as warden. Her battered body was found by a roadside in the state capital in May 2012. Mehta was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder the same month.

As BJP prepared for Mehta's induction, Mishra's family members stormed the dais, shouted slogans against him and got into a scuffle with his supporters. Mishra's sons, their maternal aunt Lalitha and other relatives reached the party's Harmu headquarters with placards demanding justice. They also submitted a memorandum against Mehta's induction to senior BJP leaders. However, he was inducted into the party with fanfare.

Chief Minister Raghubar Das (extreme right) before the BJP 'induction ceremony' in Ranchi.

Speaking to The Sunday Guardian, Abhishek Mishra said: ""The news of Mehta's induction into the party came as a rude shock to us. I am myself a member of the BJP. How can a party with a difference induct such a man into the party? He (Mehta) has done everything to derail the case, using his power, so that we do not get justice. But we have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.""

""Soon after the incident, the local Argora police came to the BJP headquarters. We handed over a complaint to them. But so far, they have not lodged an FIR. My 'Maami' (aunt), brother and myself got injured in the incident,"" said Abhishek, who is getting treatment from the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS).

Interestingly, Mehta is also involved in a case of irregularity in the Central University, Ranchi, in which the CBI has filed a chargesheet against him, besides others. Mehta has contested the Assembly elections thrice in the past-once as an Independent and twice on the JMM ticket-but lost all the time.

Reacting to the incident, senior state Congress leader Alok Dubey said: ""The BJP says it will get 65 out of 81 seats and this they want to achieve through people like Mehta. The party also inducted a member of the coal mafia, Manager Rai, whom they want to give ticket from Ramgarh, and Dhullu Mahto, who is an MLA from Baghmara and has several cases against him. BJP has become the favourite party of rapists, murderers and mafia people.""

Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Deen Dayal Burnwal, however, said: ""Mehta has not been convicted and guilty in the case. In a democratic set up, everyone has the right to join a political party. I would like to question the Mishra family as to why they did not protest when Mehta was in the JMM. We respect their right to air their grievance, but the way they protested at the party headquarters is not fair."" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Sunday Guardian.

The deceased woman has been identified as Raksha Devi (60) of Shivam Colony, Bilaspur.Raksha's daughter Seema Rani alleged that her brother Anand, his wife Sonia and friend Nayab Singh of Khanpur village in Yamunanagar district conspired and killed their mother on August 15. She stated in the complaint, ""I and my elder sister Sushma are married in the same house at Marwa Khurd village. My younger brother Anand and his family lived separately from my mother in Bilaspur. My mother lived alone as my father had died in 2017. On August 15, at 6.30 am, I received a call from Anand, who said that our mother had passed away. We reached our maternal house, where we found injury marks on the neck of my mother. I clicked some photographs. Our relatives also asked about the injury marks, following which Anand and his wife Sonia got scared and started apologising while saying that they had done a mistake. When we questioned more, they stated that they, along with Anand's friend Nayab, had killed my mother. They said their children's lives would be spoiled, following which the body was cremated.""	PANCHKULA: In a yet another blow to Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the special CBI court in Panchkula on Tuesday rejected an application moved by one of his co-accused in the case to transfer the trial of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh’s murder to some other court.The accused Krishan Lal had filed an application and had sought transfer of the case to another court on the basis that the special CBI judge had already convicted the Dera chief in two cases based on similar evidence and was likely to hold the same view in this case too.The Dera chief, presently lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak district, was convicted by the special CBI court in Panchkula on August 25, 2017 for rape of two sadhvis (female disciples) and was sentenced to 20-year imprisonment. On January 17, 2019, the same CBI court had sentenced him to life imprisonment for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati.He is facing trial in two more cases — one involving castration of almost 400 Dera followers in Sirsa and second of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh’s murder.The CBI counsel HPS Verma said that the special CBI judge Jagdeep Singh has turned down the application and adjourned the hearing in the main case for December 14.Rejecting the plea, the judge in his order said, “Motivated application for recusal needs to be dealt with sternly and is ordinarily to be viewed as interference in the due course of justice, leading to penal consequences. However, this court, being conscious of virtues of reticence and restraint in judicial conduct, is refraining from imposing exemplary costs for moving such frivolous application without any justified reason/cause. As per settled law, recusal at the asking of litigant party, unless justified, must never be acceded to. In view of afore-stated facts and circumstances and settled law, instant application, being wholly devoid of merits, stands dismissed.”The judge added, “The applicant-accused has primarily made two-fold prayer ie either to transfer the present case to some other court or to make a reference for transferring the same to another court. So far as first one is concerned, same is simply not maintainable as this court has no jurisdiction/power to transfer any matter assigned to this court as per law. Further, so far as second prayer is concerned, the same is, in a way, a prayer for recusal on the ground that this court has earlier decided two separate and different matters/trials involving one of the accused in the present matter. Needless to mention that any matter has to be decided on the basis of evidence obtaining in a particular matter and evidence in that particular matter has no bearing qua merits of any other trial pending in a court of law.”Ranjit Singh, who had reportedly developed differences with the Dera chief after the allegations of rape of sadhvis surfaced, was shot dead near his fields in Khanpur Kolian village of Kurukshetra district on July 10, 2002. The other accused in the case along with the Dera chief are Avtar Singh, Inder Sain, Dera manager Krishan Lal and shooters Jasbir Singh and Sabdil Singh.

Bawana,2019-08-31	2019-09-16	2020-01-25	2020-02-12,Hindustan Times	Hindustan Times	Hindustan Times	Business Standard,Partners arrested for murders of two women in Delhi	Delhi’s most wanted named in murder of history-sheeter	December 16 gang rape convicts in Tihar Jail on suicide watch	Man wanted in murder and other criminal cases arrested from UP's Moradabad,murder	murder	rape	murder,"Fatema Sardar was murdered and his body stuffed in a gunny bag for resisting her husband’s bid to force her into prostitution. A sex worker was murdered and her body chopped into several pieces for refusing to give up prostitution and marry her partner. The two shocking murders reported earlier this month have been solved with the police arresting the accused in both cases, police said on Saturday. The first murder was reported on August 6, when a woman’s body was found stuffed in a gunny bag in southwest Delhi’s Sagarpur. The suspect, her husband, has been arrested from Kolkata. The second case was reported on August 20, when the pieces of a woman’s body was found stuffed in bag near Bawana canal. The police have arrested the accused, a man who was in a relationship with the victim, said Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender AryaIn the first case, Arya said, ten police teams were formed to identify the victim woman through a door-to-door search. Her pictures were also circulated in the WhatsApp groups and shared on social media sites, Arya said.“On August 17, the woman was identified as Fatema Sardar by one of her relatives from 24 Parganas South, West Bengal. The relative told us that she was living in Delhi with her husband Jalil Sheikh. Further probe revealed that Sheikh had left for West Bengal the same day on which the woman’s body was found. We immediately sent a team to West Banal but found that Sheikh had already left his native place and switched off his mobile phone,” Arya said.The DCP said Sheikh’s family members and relatives were questioned and on Wednesday, he was arrested from Ballygaunje Railway Station in Kolkata.Fatema’s father and uncle also identified her and alleged that Sheikh used to demand dowry from her. Arya said, during interrogation Sheikh disclosed he had two wives, one in West Bengal and another in Delhi. “He said about seven years ago, he and Fatema started living in Delhi and then got married in 2014. Sheikh repeatedly tried to force her into prostitution but she resisted. Agitated by her stubbornness he strangled her using a chunni on August 6. He then wrapped her body in a blanket and a plastic sack before dumping it on a secluded stretch in Sagarpur. He said he had also been arrested in a human trafficking case in West Bengal,” the DCP said.In the second case reported on August 20, police said the victim was identified as a sex worker from GB Road. Her alleged partner, Mohammad Ayub, a 32-year-old man who runs a garments business,has been arrested in the case.DCP (special cell) PS Kushwah said Ayub, who is married since 2008 and has three children, came in contact with the woman from the brothel four years ago during a visit to GB Road. “Eventually Ayub and the woman got into a relationship. After four years, Ayub started forcing the woman to quit and start living with him, but she resisted. Ayub also proposed marriage but the woman turned down his proposal. Dejected with constant rejections, Ayub decided to kill her,” Kushwah said.The DCP said, on August 20, Ayub asked out the woman for an evening stroll and took her to Bawana canal. “There Ayub slit her throat with a butcher’s knife. He then chopped her body into five pieces and disfigured her face,” the officer said.Police said Ayub was arrested following surveillance.	The murder of Virender Mann, former BSP MLA candidate from outer Delhi’s Narela, who succumbed to at least 20-25 gunshot wounds earlier this month, was allegedly orchestrated by Delhi’s most wanted gangster Jitender Gogi and his associate Kapil Mann, police said Monday. Police said they have arrested Kapil for the murder and said Virender’s killing was a retaliation against another murder last year — an associate of Neeraj Bawana had allegedly gunned down one Babloo Kheda, who was Kapil’s uncle.On September 8, five men had reportedly intercepted Virender’s Hyundai Creta on Lampur Road in Outer Delhi’s Narela and sprayed 30-40 bullets at his car, while he was seated beside the driver. As many as 20-25 bullets hit Virender, killing him on the spot, while his driver miraculously escaped the firing.Virender, who had contested the assembly elections from Narela on a BSP ticket in 2013 and lost, had 13 cases registered against him, including those of murder, attempt to murder, robberies, extortion and under the Arms Act.A senior police officer probing Virender’s murder said they got sketches of suspects made with the help of locals and witnesses and found that Gogi and Kapil, who carries a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest, were present at the spot of the crime during the shooting.DCP(outer north) Gaurav Sharma said their surveillance led police teams to an input that Kapil, a resident of Kheda Khurd village, will be reaching Sector 34 near the Kheda canal on Sunday. “On this input, our special staff team laid a trap and Kapil was arrested. He was carrying a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest for his involvement in three murders, one attempt to murder, three robberies and one Arms Act case,” the DCP said.Sharma said during questioning, Kapil disclosed that on September 8, he and his men were tailing Virender’s car and when they saw Virender’s car stuck in a traffic jam, he and his associates fired indiscriminately at that vehicle. “Efforts to arrest the other suspects are being made. Among the other suspects, we have so far identified Kuldeep Fajja, who is Gogi’s confidant, and gang member Rohit Moi,” the DCP said.Another officer associated with the investigation said further interrogation of the arrested men revealed that Virender’s killing was the fallout of a murder that took place last year.“On July 31, 2018, 46-year-old Babloo Kheda was gunned down in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar. One Parvesh Mann, who was backed by gangster Neeraj Bawana, was the prime suspect. Later, in October, police arrested Parvesh Mann. Investigations revealed that the car in which he was arrested had been given to him by Virender. Kapil, the nephew of Babloo Kheda, came to know that Virender also had a role in his uncle’s murder. He told us that Virender was killed to settle scores with Bawana for plotting his uncle’s death,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.	The most guarded men in India’s largest prison, which houses over 18,000 inmates, are not Mumbai underworld gangster Chhota Rajan, Delhi’s biggest don Neeraj Bawana, or Bihar’s strongman turned politician Mohammad Shahabuddin; they are the four convicts of the December 16 gang rape and murder case, who are due to be hanged on February 1 according to the latest court directive.Prison officials said on condition of anonymity that Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Kumar Gupta (25), Akshay Thakur (31) and Vinay Sharma (26), who were moved on January 16 to Tihar’s Jail No 3, where the death sentence will be carried out, are on “suicide watch” the likes of which Tihar has never seen before.The four prisoners are lodged separately in single cells in a section of the prison’s “high-risk” ward. The living space, about six feet by eight feet, has an open front guarded by prison bars; there are no iron railings or beams overhead; no part of the cell can be covered with any cloth; for each cell, there are two guards on duty round-the-clock; and even when the prisoners use the attached toilet, their heads are visible from above a small stone partition. The cells are checked twice every day for any prohibited item that may have been sneaked in. In addition, each cell has two CCTV cameras -- and the live feed is monitored round-the-clock from a control room in the jail superintendent’s office, and an office in the prison headquarters. Before the four men were moved to these cells, the guards checked that there was no loose nail in the wall or any loose pieces of metal that could be used to hurt oneself. “The only way in which these prisoners can hurt themselves is by banging their heads against the wall. This is common method adopted by prisoners to frame the other prisoners, jail officers or postpone their hanging. In their case, even if they do this, the guards can open the cell’s lock within seconds and stop them,” said a senior prison officer, who asked not to be named.What has prompted this unprecedented level of security, said a second jail official, is that the fifth accused in the case, Ram Singh, was found hanging in the bathroom of the general ward of Jail No 3 on March 11, 2013 in one of the most high-profile incidents of a prison death in India. “This case is different. Even if one of them takes their life, it is going to cost jobs at the highest level. It won’t be wrong to say that the case is politically important for everyone,” the second officer added.Apart from the heightened security, the four are being medically examined by a prison doctor every day. A third prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said, the four men are examined once a day and a report is sent to the prison headquarters. “Their weight and physical condition is noted. It is part of a report that has to be prepared once a day. Except Pawan, the others have not displayed signs of anxiety. Maybe they believe that the hanging will be postponed again. Pawan sometimes refuses to eat,” the third officer said. Prison expert Sunil Gupta, who was Tihar’s law officer for over three decades until his retirement in 2015, said that prisoners on death row are extremely vulnerable. “I have supervised eight hangings. The security of the four men is very important. They may try hurting themselves so that the prison officers are accused of violence and the hanging is postponed again. At the same time, the four should also be counselled by religious leaders too. We used to do it,” he said. The second officer said that the men are indeed being counselled. The four are on death row for the gang rape and brutal assault of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student inside a moving bus on December 16, 2012. The young woman died in a hospital in Singapore on December 29.A city court first issued the death warrant for January 22 at 7am, and then changed it to February 1 at 6am over a legal technicality that calls for a 14-day gap between rejection of a mercy plea and the execution. Lawyers for the convicts, however, have argued that while one of the four (Mukesh Singh) has utilised all his legal options, the other three still have remedies available.Meanwhile, jail officials have started preparations for the hanging. HT reported January 13 that authorities have widened the gallows so that the four can be hanged simultaneously. Earlier, no more than two people could be hanged at the same time in Tihar	A 34-year-old man wanted in cases of murder, attempt to murder and under sections of the MCOCA, and carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on him has been arrested from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, police said on Wednesday.

Accused Pawan Pandit, a resident of Bawana, was apprehended from a house in Moudha village of Moradabad district on Tuesday based on a tip-off, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) B K Singh said.

During interrogation, Pandit confessed to have been involved in the cases of murder and attempt to murder in Sonepat and Delhi respectively, he said.

He was also found to have been involved in over 20 criminal cases, including murder, dacoity, attempt to murder, armed robbery, theft, possession of illegal firearms and criminal intimidation in Delhi and Haryana, Singh said.

Pandit was previously arrested in cases of murder, robbery, carjacking and attempt to murder by the Delhi and the Haryana Police, he added.

On January 5, 2019, he along with associates Ajay, Sunny and Manish, intercepted one Mohit and Ravi while they were travelling in their car near village Katewada, Bawana. They allegedly fired indiscriminately at the car. Mohit managed to escape but Ravi was hit multiple times. The reason behind the shooting was a monetary dispute between Ravi and Ajay, the officer said.

In September, he along with his nephew Praveen and another associate, allegedly shot dead a girl in Sonepat. Praveen had allegedly been stalking the girl for quite some time, the officer added.

Besides the two cases, Pandit was also wanted in a case under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, he said.",32	46	23	34,0	0	0	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/partners-arrested-for-murders-of-two-women-in-delhi/story-YlMgPzjJm7NcPx0OQGzxHM.html	https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-most-wanted-named-in-murder-of-history-sheeter/story-PSl5V18O44xNG5y53J7RHL.html	https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/december-16-rape-convicts-tihar-s-most-guarded/story-bryHwHXk9B89182MAWKM8L.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/man-wanted-in-murder-and-other-criminal-cases-arrested-from-up-s-moradabad-120021201702_1.html,77

Kishan Khosla, a 91-year-old retired government employee, and his domestic help, Kishan, were missing since Sunday morning, they said.

Several teams were formed to trace the duo and on Monday, the domestic help and four of his accomplices -- Deepak Yadav, Pradeep Sharma, Sarvesh and Prabhudayal -- were arrested, a senior officer said.

During interrogation, the domestic help revealed that he had strangulated his employer and had planned to kidnap the elderly man a month ago, police said, adding that the body of Kishan Khsola was found in a pit in Sangam Vihar.

Kishan also said that he was fed up with the taunts and abuses of his employer, sources said.

The businessman son of Kishan Khosla found his mother, Saroj Khosla (87), unconscious when he visited the flat on Sunday morning and informed the police.

Besides the refrigerator, jewellery and cash were also missing from the residence Kishan Khosla, the officer said.

Saroj Khosla complained that their domestic help mixed some sedative in tea on Saturday night. The domestic help belonged to Bihar and lived locally at Sangam Vihar, he said.

The tempo used to carry the refrigerator was recovered from outside Pradeep Sharma's house. The refrigerator has also been found, police said.

The security guards of the area claimed that they saw the domestic help carrying the fridge in a tempo along with his accomplices. He told the guards that he was taking the fridge for repair when they questioned him, they said.

The couple was living in a rented first floor flat of a building in Greater Kailash-I for the last few months. They have two sons one of whom lives in Australia while the other is a businessman who resides in a nearby area, police said.	Police suspect that a 91-year-old retired government employee was kidnapped by his domestic help who locked him in a refrigerator and carried it away in a tempo, after the duo was found was missing under mysterious circumstances from South Delhi's posh Greater Kailash area.

Jewellery and cash besides the refrigerator were stolen from the house of Kishan Khosla, who was found missing since Sunday morning, said a senior police officer.

The businessman son of Khosla found his mother, Saroj Khosla (87), unconscious when he visited the flat on Sunday morning and informed the police.

Saroj Khosla complained that their domestic help, who is also named Kishan, mixed some sedative in tea on Saturday night. The domestic help belonged to Bihar and lived locally at Sangam Vihar, he said.

The security guards of the area claimed that they saw the domestic help carrying the fridge in a tempo along with his accomplices. He told the guards that he was taking the fridge for repair when they questioned him, police said.

""It is suspected that the elderly man was kept inside the fridge,"" a police officer said.

The couple lived on rented first floor flat of a building in the Greater Kailash-I for last few months. They have two sons one of whom lives in Australia while the other is a businessman who resides in a nearby area, police said.

The CCTV cameras in the area including one at the parking lot near the couple's building were not functioning so there was no video footage available which could have helped in investigation, the police officer said.

""We are trying to scan more CCTV cameras in the area for clues,"" he said.

Several teams have been formed to find out the missing elderly man and the domestic help.	New Delhi Having exhumed the body of the 91-year-old man from a plot in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar late Monday night, police on Tuesday said that the killers had planned the killing a month ago. But, despite this, the decision to use a refrigerator to discreetly move the body of Kishan Dev Khosla from his house in Greater Kailash to the burial site was taken on the spur of the moment, said Parvinder Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (south) [ADCP].Through Monday, police arrested five suspects, including Khosla’s full-time domestic help and alleged mastermind, 25-year-old Kishan. Singh quoted Kishan as claiming that he had killed Khosla for “scolding him frequently”, and to rob him. However, Singh said other motives were still being probed.“Kishan had taken a small house on rent in Sangam Vihar on August 28 and dug a five-foot deep pit nearby,” said Singh.Kundesh Gupta, a resident of the Sangam Vihar neighbourhood, said, “They said they were constructing a water storage tank. Since Sangam Vihar grapples with water problems, we believed them,” said Gupta.ADCP Singh said that the probe revealed that Kishan had offered tea laced with sedatives to Khosla and his 87-year-old wife, Saroj, Saturday. “Once the couple were unconscious, Kishan called five of his associates who arrived in a goods carrier owned by Sangam Vihar resident Pradeep Sharma,” said Singh.While Sharma was also arrested, his neighbour Brijpal Upadhyay said that he may not have been aware of the murder plot. “When some people (the murder suspects) had approached Sharma at 5 pm on Saturday to hire his goods carrier, he turned it down saying that it was a no-entry time (for goods vehicles in the city). But they said that they would bear the challan, if caught,” he said.“Kishan strangled Khosla, but spared Saroj as she treated him well. But they had not decided on how to transport the body without anyone noticing. So, they emptied a double-door refrigerator of the Khosla family, stuffed the body in and drove away,” said the officer, adding that the police awaited Khosla’s autopsy report.Singh said that the men buried the body in the pit. “In between all this, they also used Khosla’s ATM cards to withdraw ₹40,000,” said Singh. The police arrested Kishan and another suspect from Uttar Pradesh, and three others from Delhi. At their instance, the location of the body was identified.Singh said that several questions have remained unanswered. “It is surprising that they made so much effort to move Khosla’s body in a refrigerator when they could have left it at the murder spot and escaped,” said ADCP Parvinder Singh.	A 29-year-old woman and a man were arrested for allegedly kidnapping a 12-day-old baby in the national capital, police said on Monday.

Ruby Khatoon was arrested from Saket while her accomplice Shah Mohammad was nabbed from Sangam Vihar area and the child was recovered, police said.

Khattoon had took the baby of her co-worker Meenakshi Sharma on the pretext of taking care of him, the police said.

In her complaint, Sharma told police, Ruby Khatoon and I worked in the same store. After I told her that I was pregnant, she told me that she wants a baby but couldn't conceive one. Later, she introduced me to her husband Rakesh Kumar. They told me that they wanted to take care of the baby and helped me during pregnancy. On September 17, I delivered the baby in a hospital in Delhi. On the same day, they asked to take away the baby. They told me that it was only for a few days and that I could contact them at any time. I gave them my child but after sometime when I tried to contact them they wouldn't take my calls.

The woman then searched for Khatoon and her husband. Through the neighbours, she came to know that Ruby wasn't married, the police said.

I came to know that she was in Saket Court with a man. I went there and saw her with Kumar. I confronted her about my child but she refused to tell me anything, said Sharma.

Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (South) said, ""We received a complaint that two women were fighting outside the court. The officers rushed to the court and found that Sharma's baby was kidnapped. We arrested Ruby who later told us that she gave the child to a man named Shah Mohammad. The man was arrested from Sangam Vihar and the baby was recovered from his possession.

The police said that Ruby went to the court to get married to Kumar.

Ruby and Mohammad have been arrested and a case of kidnapping has been registered at the Saket police station while Kumar is being questioned, police added.	A 24-year-old man allegedly involved in several cases of theft and burglary was arrested in South Delhi, officials said on Thursday.

Based on a tip-off, police laid a trap and arrested Pawan, a resident of Khori village in Faridabad district, from MB road on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur.

Stolen items, including gold ornaments and mobile phones, were seized from his possession, he said.

Gyanender Kangar, a resident of Tuglakabad village, was on the run for over a year and was carrying a bounty of Rs 50,000, they said.

""On Saturday, police got a tip-off that Kangar would come near Amity International School, Saket, following which a trap was laid and Kangar was arrested around 4.30 pm,"" said Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).

Kangar has four brothers and Subhash, one of them, had a property dispute over a plot of land in his village with one Jitender, police said.

On June 8, 2018, Jitender, along with his family members, came to the house of Subhash for settlement, but a heated argument started between them. Subhash and his other family members attacked Jitender and his family with wooden sticks, they said.

Jitender and four members of his family got severe injuries. Kartar, one of accused, had also fired with his license pistol. Jitender succumbed to his injuries in hospital, police said.

Seven persons have already been arrested but Subhash, his son Manish and brother Kangar were absconding, they added.	Four men allegedly involved in over 100 cases of burglary and theft were arrested near Mayur Vihar Extension, police said on Friday.

Those arrested were identified as Sheikh Saifuddin (25), Wasim Akram (24) and Anwar (35), all residents of Jahangir Puri, and Mumtaz (25), a resident of Bhalswa.

The four men also disclosed the name of a person who they used to sell the stolen articles, police said, adding that efforts were being made to nab him.

A car, one country-made pistol along with two live cartridges, two cutters and a screw driver were seized from their possession, police said.	The Friday morning encounter of all the four accused in the brutal rape-and-murder case of a 25-year-old woman veterinarian last month in Hyderabad triggered a nationwide debate on justice delivery, with one side supporting it as speedy justice and the other raising concerns over 'extra-judicial' measures.

Here is a look at the legal status of some rape cases which shook the country.

Unnao rape case 



The 2017 case of alleged kidnapping and rape of the then minor girl by ex-BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao was transferred by the Supreme Court to a trial court in Delhi with a direction to CBI to complete the investigation within seven days.

On August 2 it directed that CBI could avail additional seven days in exceptional circumstances.

The court initiated 'in-camera' proceedings from September 11 at AIIMS, where she was admitted after an accident on July 28, for recording her statement. The victim and her lawyer were critically injured and two of her aunts were killed in the accident.

Besides the main rape case and the accident case, three other matters transferred to Delhi are -- the FIR against victim's father under Arms Act; his custodial death and a separate gang rape of the victim.

The three accused in the gang rape case -- Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav Singh and Shubham Singh -- are all out on bail.

The final arguments in the case are on under District Judge Dharmesh Sharma, who recently concluded recording statements of defence witnesses and started hearing the CBI's arguments.

Several minor girls were sexually and physically assaulted in a shelter home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur, which came to light after a TISS report was given to the Bihar government on May 26, 2018, in which former Bihar People's Party MLA Brajesh Thakur is the prime accused.

The verdict in the case is likely on December 12, a month after its earlier decided date.

The CBI told the special court that there was enough evidence against all the 20 accused in the case.

On May 29 last year the state government shifted the girls from the shelter home to other protection homes and on May 31 the FIR was lodged against the 11 accused in the case.

The Supreme Court on August 2 took cognisance of the case and transferred the probe to CBI on November 28. On February 7 this year, the cases were transferred from a local court in Muzaffarpur to a POCSO court at Saket district court in Delhi.

The court reserved order on September 30 after final arguments by the CBI counsel and 11 accused in the case, also including ex-Bihar Social Welfare Minister and the then JD(U) leader Manju Verma, who faced flak as allegations surfaced that Thakur had links with her husband.

Nirbhaya rape case 



In the December 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case of a 23-year old paramedic student in Delhi, the Supreme Court in July last year dismissed review pleas of three of the four convicts, upholding their death penalty.

It rejected the review pleas filed by Mukesh (30), Gupta (23) and Sharma (23), saying no grounds were made out by them for a review of the verdict.

The fourth death row convict, Singh (32), did not file a review petition against the apex court's May 5, 2017 judgment.

Recently three convicts, facing gallows in the gang rape and murder case, wrote to the jail authorities, seeking withdrawal of an October 29 notification granting them seven days' time to file mercy pleas with the president against their execution.

The jail authorities had informed the Nirbhaya gang rape case convicts that they had exhausted all legal remedies and were only left with the provision of filing a mercy petition against the death sentence before the president.

The top court, in its 2017 verdict, upheld the capital punishment awarded to them by Delhi High Court and trial court.

One of the accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail here.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board. He was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

Kathua rape case 



The 2018 rape and murder of an 8-year-old nomadic girl in a Kathua village had seen conviction of six people. Four months later, in October, a court in Jammu however directed the police to register an FIR against six members of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which probed the case, for allegedly torturing and coercing witnesses to give false statements.

Judicial Magistrate Prem Sagar gave the direction to senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Jammu on an application by Sachin Sharma, Neeraj Sharma and Sahil Sharma, who were witnesses in the case, saying cognizable offences are made out against the six.

In June this year, District and Sessions Judge Tejwinder Singh sentenced to life imprisonment the three main accused, while awarding five years in jail to three others for destruction of evidence in the case that shook the nation.

The trial was shifted to Pathankot in Punjab on the order of the Supreme Court after lawyers in Kathua attempted to prevent submission of the charge sheet in court.

According to the charge sheet, the girl who was kidnapped on January 10 last year, was allegedly raped in captivity in a small village temple in the district after being kept sedated for four days before she was bludgeoned to death.

The abduction, rape and killing of the child was part of a carefully planned strategy to remove the minority nomadic community from the area, it said.

Even after 11 months of the murder, the police have not been able to arrest the main accused Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh.

Apart from this, the police have not been able to find out where both of them are hiding. This case of killing of both brothers had caught so much emphasis that Ranchi Police had constituted three SITs on the same day to catch the main accused.

The SIT was also conducting raids under the leadership of the then City SP Sujata Veenapani. The SIT had raided several places in Bihar, Bengal and UP. But even after this, the police could not trace the location of both the main accused.

Both the main accused have been declared a fugitive
Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh, the main accused in the Agarwal brothers murder case, have been declared as fugitives in July last year. Now the Ranchi Police can auction the real estate of both.

According to the rules, even after three months of attachment, if the accused is not arrested or he does not surrender, then the police can auction his immovable property which is in the name of the accused. Significantly, the Ranchi police has attached the house and office of the main accused Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh.

Did not surrender even after attachment
In the Agarwal Brothers murder case, the police have already arrested two bodyguards of Lokesh, Dharmendra Tiwari, Sunil Kumar and driver Shankar. Dharmendra Tiwari and Sunil were also questioned on remand. During the interrogation, both of them gave many important information about the murder.

After MK Singh and Lokesh Chaudhary were not arrested, the Ranchi Police ordered them to surrender by sticking commercials at the house of both the accused. But both did not surrender, after which both houses were attached. Despite this, both of them have neither surrendered in court nor surrendered before the police.

Three people involved in the murder are in police custody
Three of the five people involved in the Agarwal brothers murder case are currently in jail. On March 8, two days after the murder, the police arrested Shankar, the driver of Lokesh Chaudhary. Then the bodyguard Sunil Singh was arrested by the police.

While another bodyguard Dharmendra Tiwari surrendered in court. Both bodyguards had revealed in this case that both brothers were murdered by Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh for money. But how much the amount was, till date it has not been disclosed.

The advantage of political outreach
According to the information, Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh are hiding somewhere in Bihar. It is being told that Lokesh Chaudhary is taking advantage of political reach due to his good hold in Bihar's political corridor.

Because of this, the police are not finding success in arresting Lokesh Chaudhary and MK Singh. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from NewsWing.

Accused Says They Got Thrashed At Cafe

NEW DELHI: The sensational murder of a property dealer turned politician, who was shot dead in Dwarka on Tuesday by two assailants in a daring attack captured on CCTV camera, was a fallout of a fight that took place in a cafe run by the victim, police said after arresting one of the alleged shooters on Thursday.The victim, Narendra Gehlot, had contested the last municipal elections as an independent and lost. He had slapped the shooter, Nakul Sangwan, at his cafe after locking him up following an altercation, police said. Sangwan, who is the cousin of gangster Kapil Sangwan, was nursing a grudge against Gehlot ever since, and decided to eliminate him to avenge the insult, police added.Police arrested Sangwan near Dwarka on Thursday after laying a trap. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said a team led by ACP Rajinder Singh confronted Sangwan near Goyla Dairy. When he saw the police team, Sangwan tried to whip out his pistol and fire but was overpowered by the team. The .32 bore pistol he had used for the murder was recovered from him.Cops found that Sangwan was earlier involved in another murder in Aman Vihar near Rohini. The victim was a youth named Pushkar, whom Sangwan suspected of passing on information to his rivals about the movement of the family members of one of his associates. That murder too was captured in a CCTV camera.During interrogation, Sangwan told the cops that in July this year, he and his friend Rohit had gone to a cafe run by Gehlot’s relatives on the third floor of his office near Dwarka More. Rohit had a running dispute with Gehlot and his relative, claiming that he had lent them money for the cafe which Gehlot had refused to return.Finding them sitting in the cafe, Gehlot challenged them which led to an argument during which he allegedly shut the door and called in a few of his employees to thrash Sangwan and Rohit. Angered by the insult, Sangwan was looking for an oppurtunity to take revenge and had kept a watch outside Gehlot’s shop to track his movements, police said.On Tuesday, he and one of his associates waylaid Gehlot while he was leaving his shop, and started firing at his car. When Gehlot tried to flee, Sangwan climbed on a car parked near Gehlot’s car and shot him dead.Sangwan told cops that he had dropped out of a Haryana college while pursuing a BSc course. He was inspired by his cousin Kapil, who has been absconding for the past few years. He had joined Kapil’s gang and was a notorious sharpshooter of the Nandu gang. He was arrested last year in a murder case at Baba Haridass Nagar, and was released from the jail in June 2019. Sangwan had started extorting money from businessmen in Dwarka and adjoning areas.Police are now on the lookout for his associate, who had also fired at Gehlot.

The Supreme Court Thursday awarded life sentence to Sharda Jain, a former Congress MCD councillor, and a co-accused for conspiring to abduct and kill her fellow party councillor Atma Ram Gupta over 17 years ago here.

Jain, the then councillor from Keshavpuram municipal ward in northwest Delhi, was accused of hatching a conspiracy to murder Gupta, a senior councillor from Trinagar, as she did not like his intimacy with another party corporator Memwati Barwala.

Gupta, who had gone with Jain on August 24, 2002, to attend a Congress rally at Ferozshah Kotla ground, was kidnapped and found murdered after five days in a canal in Bulandshar district of Uttar Pradesh.

A bench of Justices M M Shantanagoudar and Ajay Rastogi upheld the verdicts of the Delhi High Court and the Rohini Trial court finding Jain and co-accused Rajender guilty and asked them to surrender forthwith to serve the life term.

The top court, however, acquitted third accused Raj Kumar of the charges framed against him.

""Criminal Appeal...filed by Sharda Jain (A-1) is dismissed. The judgment and order of conviction passed against her stands affirmed for the offences under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) ...Vide order..., Jain was granted bail. Accordingly, her bail bonds are cancelled. She shall be taken into custody immediately to serve out the remainder of her sentence,"" the bench ordered.

The court noted that it was Jain who took police officials to the spot where the councillor was murdered.

""We do not find any valid ground to disbelieve their testimony, particularly when they are independent, unbiased police officials. There was no reason for them to falsely depose against Sharda Jain, who was also a public servant, being a Councillor of the MCD. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the circumstance of Sharda Jain pointing out the place of the murder of the deceased is proved,"" it said.

It also said the courts below are justified in concluding that the deceased was last seen in the company of Sharda Jain and ""that the time gap between the last seen and the time of the death of the deceased is so small so as to make it impossible for the deceased to come in the contact of any other person. Further, since no plausible explanation has been given by Sharda Jain as to how and when she parted company with the deceased"".

As per the prosecution, Gupta went missing on Augist 24, 2002 after he left his residence to go to the Congress Party's rally along with Jain at the Ferozshah Kotla Grounds.

""It is the case of the prosecution that Sharda Jain had developed close relations with the deceased. When he began ignoring her for another woman, she hatched a conspiracy with her brother, Raj Kumar and two other persons, Rajender and Roshan Singh to murder him,"" the court said.

The trial court, in 2006, had convicted Jain, Raj Kumar, Rajender and Roshan Singh and five others in the case for their varied roles.

The High Court affirmed the conviction of Sharda Jain, Raj Kumar, Rajender and Roshan Singh and had acquitted five others -- Pushpender, Nirvikar, Shri Pal Singh Raghav, Satender Kumar and Rakesh Kumar.

Roshan Singh died in 2010 and the case against him was abated.	NEW DELHI: The arrest of four people, including two mobile snatchers, on Tuesday solved the murder of a transporter’s employee in Rohini last week. The employee was found dead with stab wounds near Madhuban Chowk. 

After a police investigation, it was found the men who had snatched the phone had sold it to a receiver of stolen goods. The mastermind is said to be a juvenile, who was also nabbed on Monday. 

The murder came to light last Tuesday when cops at the Mangolpuri police station were informed about an unidentified body lying in the bushes. When cops reached the scene, they found a man with stab wounds on his chest and abdomen. Later, the victim was identified as Sudhir Dabas, a resident of Mangolpur Kalan village. 

 

The police probe also revealed that Sudhir, who worked for a transporter, was on his way back from work when he was killed. The family members reported that his mobile was missing from his personal belongings. 

“A police team formed to track down the killers found that his mobile phone was switched on by someone nearby. The person was tracked down and arrested,” said DCP (outer Delhi) A Koan. On being questioned, Raja Prasad said he had bought the phone from one Arpit. Based on his inputs, Arpit, too, was arrested from Mangolpuri. During his interrogation, Arpit admitted that he was aware of the phone belonging to a murder victim. He revealed that a juvenile and his friend, identified as Harish, had sold the mobile to him. The duo were tracked down and caught near Madhuban Chowk. While Harish was taken into custody, the juvenile was sent to a reforms home. 

When questioned, Harish told cops that he and the juvenile were consuming drugs near Madhuban Chowk when they saw the victim. They followed him until they reached a secluded spot where they held him at knifepoint and asked him to hand over his belongings. When he tried to resist, the duo attacked him with the knife. When he fell bleeding, they took his phone and fled. The phone was sold for Rs 1,500 to Arpit with which the duo bought drugs. Harish claimed it was the juvenile’s plan to rob the victim. Efforts are on to nab the rest of the gang members.	A Delhi court has acquitted a man of the charge of allegedly raping his maid on the grounds that the victim ""contacted the police after three months"" and she continued working there even after the incident.

The court noted that after lodging of the FIR, when she was medically examined by the doctors, she did not name her employer as the assaulter.

""No lady, who had been raped recently by the employer, would again join him because it would send a clear signal to the employer that she was ready and willing in that kind of activity. Such return would definitely make believe an employer that the girl was desirous of indulging in sexual activities with him,"" Additional Sessions Judge Umed Singh Grewal said.

The court said the woman, who was allegedly raped in 2010, did not disclose the incident to any of her acquaintances for a long time nor did she lodge an FIR for three months.

Besides saying that there was ""no explanation for the delay"", the court also observed that the woman, who had continued working in the same house after the incident, did not fall in the category of 'sterling quality' evidence.

The woman had again joined the duty after one or two days.

According to the complaint, the victim started working as a maid in a house in Rohini in November 2009. She was employed through placement agency 'Domestic Help Services'.

The woman alleged in her complaint that after five or six days, she was allegedly raped by her employer's father.

The victim ran away from their home on March 14, 2010 and told her relatives about the incident after which the accused was arrested on March 16 that year and subsequently an FIR was lodged.

However, according to the man, the woman had left the house on March 14 without any prior information and later, he was demanded Rs 5 lakhs for not being implicated in a false case.

The court noted that the woman had sufficient opportunity to complain but she kept mum.

""This kind of cross examination shows that she had sufficient opportunity to complain not only to placement agency persons but also to the police that she had been raped. She had stepped out of the house of the accused several times. But she kept mum not only to placement agency persons but also to the police that she had been raped. She had stepped out of the house of the accused several times. But she kept mum,"" the court noted.	Police said that the accused Satish Chaudhary showed no remorse during interrogation

NEW DELHI: Satish Chaudhary (64), who stabbed his wife and airhostess daughter-in-law at their apartments in Rohini Sector-5, was planning their murder for the last seven days. The accused started thinking of eliminating them after he got to know that they would be moving to their Gurugram house on Friday.As per investigating officials, Satish had purchased a big knife from the market to murder them. “He hid the knife in his room and wanted to murder them on Wednesday, but since his younger son Saurabh was at home he could not do so. On the day of the incident, he pretended to go to sleep, but stayed awake in his room. He waited for his son to sleep,” an officer privy to the investigation said.Satish, who worked as a private tutor, latched the door of Saurabh’s room before attacking his wife Snehlata, 62, and Pragya, 35, who was married to his elder son Gaurav. The accused suspected both women of having extramarital relationships. His grandchildren, aged three and one, were in the same room where the murders took place.Snehlata and Pragya were to move to Gurugram on Friday morning but the accused wanted them to leave their jewellery and valuables behind. The women had refused to leave them which had aggravated his anger.During interrogation, the accused was remorseless and kept on saying degrading things about the two women. An officer who interrogated him revealed that he even went on to say that Saurabh was not his own child.	A gym owner from Delhi, who was on the run after allegedly murdering his girlfriend and a cab driver, was nabbed by the police in Gujarat on Wednesday.

The arrest was made thanks to the alertness of a local car dealer in the Valsad city, who informed the police about the accused, Hemant Lamba.

Lamba, who is an international-level bodybuilder and a fitness expert, had allegedly shot his 22-year-old girlfriend on her head four times in Dharuhera town in Rewari district on December 7. He then disposed her body in a secluded area and escaped in a rented cab, police said.

Rewari DSP Jammal Khan said that doctors on Sunday had conducted a postmortem of the victim's body. A case of murder was registered against Lamba, who was absconding after the incident.

After the murder, Lamba, who was travelling in the cab, asked its driver Devendra at gunpoint to take him to Jaipur. However, the accused allegedly shot him dead later.

Lamba then drove down to Valsad in Gujarat and wanted to sell off the car. He came in contact with a local car dealer named Alpesh, who smelled something fishy after seeing the accused's urgency to sell off the vehicle, according to police.

The dealer then noticed a phone number on the rear of the car. When he called that number, the wife of the cab driver, picked up the phone.

After coming to know the reality, the dealer contacted the police, who then arrested the accused, police further said.

According to the FIR and chargesheet, Soran was arrested on July 11, 2018 but was released on bail on July 30 the same year. Ever since, Soran had been pressuring the family for a compromise.“My daughter is terrified as the accused continues to haunt our family. He has accosted me many a time and even threatened my daughter when she had gone to appear in her exams in a local college. He hounded my daughter so badly the last time that she had to be admitted to Delhi’s St. Stephens Hospital because of trauma and could not make it to the court hearing,” the survivor’s father said.	A rape accused out on bail here allegedly warned the victim against deposing in the court or face consequences worse than the Unnao tragedy, in which a girl was burnt to death recently.

The accused allegedly on Tuesday pasted a warning outside the house of the 19-year-old victim, who was scheduled to give her statement in a court on Friday.

The note read if she testified in the court on Friday the consequences will be very bad or worse than Unnao"".

In a shock, the girl's family informed police after which accused Soharan was arrested, Baghpat SP Pratap Gopendra said on Friday.

The SP said security had been stepped up around the victim's house and policemen would accompany her to the court in Delhi and bring her back.

The in-charge of the Badaut police station, R K Singh, quoting the complaint of the victim's father said the girl, who was taking coaching in Delhi, was allegedly gangraped by the youth and two others at his room in March 2018.

They had allegedly served her a cold drink laced with intoxicants.

They also made a video of the incident and raped her many times, threatening to upload it on social media, Singh said.

Fed up with the harassment, the girl informed her parents after which an FIR was lodged with the Mukherjee Nagar police in Delhi on July 9, 2018.

The case was being heard in a Rohini court in Delhi and the accused was out on bail, Singh said.

Shalimar Bagh,2019-09-09	2019-09-09,Hindustan Times	Business Standard,"Burglary bid foiled, four arrested in Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh	Four held for burglary bid at gold loan company office in Delhi",burglary	burglary,"The police on Monday arrested four suspected burglars, including a Nepal citizen, and claimed to have foiled a burglary of a gold finance company in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh. The police said the four men were caught red-handed, while they were breaking a wall of the gold finance company’s office and were about to enter the premises. They had planned to break a locker that contained 18 kilograms of gold, ₹5 lakh and other valuables, the police said. Those arrested were identified as Panchu Ram Mandal, Pheku Basak, Mohijur, of Sahibganj in Jharkhand, and Nirjan Joshi of Nepal. The police recovered a countrymade pistol with one cartridge and house breaking equipment from the four. The deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said that the arrests came during the tenant verification drive in resettlement colonies. During one such drive, a team of the Shalimar Bagh police received information about a few men, who had recently rented a godown and a house. The information was developed and it was learnt that the men were often seen entering a godown, which is to the rear of the gold finance company’s office. Around 2.30pm on Sunday, the team checked around the building and found a man standing outside the godown. Seeing the police party, the man, Joshi, ran inside, but was caught. “Our team members checked the godown and found two men making a hole in the wall using spades. Another man was standing nearby with a spade in his hand. They were arrested,” said Arya. During questioning, the DCP said, the arrested men said they had planned to burgle the gold finance company office with the help of a person who had details of the office and its surroundings.“They rented the godown on rent so that they could bore a hole and enter the finance company office without getting caught. They chose Sunday since it was an off day. We are now looking for the person who played a key role in the planning,” said an investigator.	Four men, including a Nepal national, who allegedly attempted to burgle a gold loan finance company's office in Delhi's Shalimar Bagh were arrested, police said on Monday.

The accused were identified as Panchu Ram Mandal, Pheku Basak, Mohijur, residents of Jharkhand and Nirjan Joshi, a resident of Nepal, they said.

Police got a tip-off about some suspicious persons who had recently moved into the area, following which they checked around the Manappuram Gold loan office on Sunday at around 2.30 pm, a senior police officer said.

""At the office's back side, they saw Joshi standing outside a godown and on seeing the police, he ran inside the godown. Police chased Joshi and apprehended him. They checked inside the godown and found three persons making a manhole and trying to break the wall with help of spades. Later, they were also apprehended,"" said Vijayanta Arya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest).

Interrogation revealed that the accused hatched a conspiracy with their associate who had a complete knowledge about the finance company's office at Singalpur village in Shalimar Bagh and its surrounding area, the DCP said.

They took a godown, situated behind the Manappuram office, on rent around 10 days ago. They started breaking the wall of godown which led them into the bathroom of the office, the officer said.

They made a manhole inside the wall. The accused were arrested when they were about to enter their targeted office. The lockers in the premises reportedly contained around 18 kg gold and Rs 5 lakh cash along with other valuables, they said.

A case was registered against Kamal Dahiya, the owner of the rented premises, for not conducting tenant verification.

One country-made pistol, one live cartridge and some equipment used for housebreaking were recovered from their possession, police said, adding that efforts are being made to arrest the absconding accused.",-1	-1,0	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/burglary-bid-foiled-four-arrested-in-delhi-s-shalimar-bagh/story-92Vp1jG3K6tQQXKb0rTVAM.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/four-held-for-burglary-bid-at-gold-loan-company-office-in-delhi-119090901162_1.html,89

The attack on Chaudhary, near the city’s central HUDCO Place, was foiled by a passing police patrol, which arrested two of the four attackers in what seemed to be an incident of road rage. Two more were arrested later. However, on Monday police said that the four were hired by a private contractor from south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj area, Ashok Kumar Singh,60, through a property dealer, and were promised Rs 6 lakh to kill Chaudhary. Rs 2 lakh of this was paid as advance, the police claimed. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) G Ram Gopal Naik confirmed the arrest of Singh and the property dealer, Sunil Balara, but refused to share more details about the case. “It will hamper the ongoing probe,” the officer said. The SAIL executive said he always suspected it was more than road rage. “What happened with me on that day made me suspect that it was not a road rage or robbery attempt but a deep-rooted conspiracy. It has now come true. I am surprised that Singh has been granted bail. I am hoping that the police will unravel the entire conspiracy.” A senior police officer, who asked not to be named, said that Singh was miffed with Chaudhary because SAIL cancelled a Rs 100 crore coal supply contract with him after it found the quality of the fuel to be poor. “Since Chaudhary refused to go through with the deal despite multiple meetings, Singh developed a grudge against him and planned to get him killed to overcome losses he suffered in the deal,” added the officer. Police said that Singh hoped SAIL would appoint a new chairman after Chaudhary’s death and he would be in a better position to get his contract through. On August 7 around 10.30 pm, Chaudhary was on his way home in his Corolla Altis when a Honda City car came dangerously close to his car, scraped it, and after the vehicle stopped, attacked Chaudhary and his driver. “The four would have killed the SAIL chairman had two police bike patrolling teams that were in the area, not spotted the ruckus and managed to catch two of the attacker on the spot. They were assaulting Chaudhary with an iron rod and a paper cutter. Chaudhary suffered multiple injuries and cuts,” said another police officer associated with the case who asked not to be named. The questioning of the two attackers, Lalit Kumar and Amarjeet Singh, led to the arrest of the absconding ones, Om Prakash and Pravesh (who uses only one name). Police found contradictions in the statements of the four men and suspected a larger conspiracy. Further interrogation revealed that they were hired to kill Chaudhary by Satender Katyan alias Chutku. Katyan disclosed after he was arrested that he hired the four men on the instructions of his brother-in-law, Sunil Balara, a property dealer. The case was transferred to the crime branch on August 23 to unravel the conspiracy and nab the conspirators. On August 27, Balara was arrested and he spilled the beans. On Friday, the police arrested Singh from his home.Senior advocate Hariharan, who represented Singh in the court, dismissed police’s claims. He said Singh was falsely implicated in the case and police arrested him merely on the disclosure statements of the four arrested attackers.“The court granted bail to Singh because police failed to provide any evidence that could prove his role in the attack. The police initially said it was a road rage case and then claimed that the four men attacked SAIL chairman for robbery. Later, they arrested Singh and claimed that he was the owner of the company which was having a dispute with SAIL over coal deal. But the police failed to furnish evidence to prove that Singh or his son is the owner of the said company,” said Hariharan.	A 27-year-old man wanted in more than 33 cases of ATM robbery across India has been arrested from south Delhi's Vasant Kunj area, police said on Saturday.

Zahid, of Haryana's Mewat district, was wanted in several ATM-breaking cases and was frequently changing his hideouts in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi, police said.

""On Wednesday, police got a tip-off that Zahid would come near Power Sub Station, Nelson Mandela Marg, Vasant Kunj, to meet his contact, following which a trap was laid and the accused was arrested at around 6.10 pm,"" said Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).

Interrogation revealed that in 2012 while he was doing his graduation, Zahid was arrested in an ATM cash theft case of Geeta Colony area, the officer said.

After getting released on bail, he and his associate got involved in cases of ATM robbery in Delhi, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chennai and Haryana, police said.

They used to target ATM which are at isolated places and unguarded. They used to cut the machine with the help of gas-cutter after covering their faces with spray paint, the officer said.

The incident was first reported by TOI on Sunday.Senior police officers said that the accused, identified as Kasim, Mohammad Razi, Balkrishan, Fardeen Siddiqui, Mamoon Ahmed and Tasleem were arrested with the looted jewellery and cash. The gang had been working in the house after being hired for renovation work by the victim, a 58-year-old woman.Police said the robbery was planned by one Shanu, who had come to the house to work as a carpenter.After attacking the woman and her housemaid, the gang locked them up in a room and fled with the valuables.One of the robbers was seen in CCTV footage of the area. Razi was nabbed, who confessed to the crime and gave up the names of his other associates.After raids in several areas in NCR, the other five accused were also arrested. The manhunt for the mastermind, Shanu, is on. The pistol used in the crime has been seized.	A 15-year-old girl, who became pregnant after being raped, died on Saturday at west Delhi’s DDU Hospital, where she was admitted after her 22-week pregnancy was illegally terminated, the police said on Sunday.A person who claims to be a minor has been apprehended for the rape, but the police are yet to determine who was responsible for the botched termination of the pregnancy, said Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west).“The child was taken to the hospital by her parents. We are trying to speak to them to find out who terminated the pregnancy, as well as what methods and medication were used,” Purohit said. The police will have more clarity once the autopsy is performed on Monday by a team of doctors. In the meantime, the police have registered a case of rape and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act against the apprehended suspect. “We have also added sections of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and causing disappearance of evidence, and it will be applicable against whoever was behind the termination,” Purohit added.An abandoned foetus was found on Sunday in the same premises of the hospital, but the police said there was nothing to link the two incidents. “The girl’s pregnancy had already been terminated by the time she was admitted to the hospital by her parents on Friday evening,” Purohit said.The girl lived with her parents in Naraina and was a school dropout. Her father is employed at a factory in the locality. The apprehended boy who claims to be a minor lived in their building itself. The police, however, suspect he is an adult. “We are getting his age determined,” the DCP said.The suspect works at a printing press in west Delhi.The suspect allegedly befriended the girl and raped her, leaving her pregnant. “When her parents got to know of the boy befriending their daughter, they confronted and forced him to relocate. He eventually moved to Rajouri Garden,” said another investigator, who asked not to be named.“Her pregnancy was terminated recently. That led to complications, and her condition deteriorated. On Friday evening, her parents brought her to DDU Hospital in a serious condition. She died on Saturday morning, after which doctors alerted us around 9.30am,” Purohit said.The suspect was identified after the police started questioning people who knew the girl. He was subsequently apprehended and booked. The police continue to probe the circumstances of the termination of the pregnancy which led to her death. However, they are yet to determine whether it took place at a hospital, or elsewhere.	NEW DELHI: A 15-year-old girl died due to complications in abortion of a pregnancy , which was the result of rape by her neighbour in west Delhi’s Naraina.The incident came to the fore on Saturday morning when the doctors at DDU Hospital reported the unnatural death of the teenager.It was found that the girl was a school dropout and acquainted with the accused. Both their families had cordial relations. A few months ago, the accused lured her on the pretext of having lunch at his house and raped her.The girl didn’t tell her parents anything. However, when she started showing signs of pregnancy, she told her mother. Her parents first tried to convince the accused to marry her, but his family refused. After an argument, both families jointly decided on aborting the fetus. They allegedly took her to a doctor for abortion, but complications developed as the fetus was over 22 weeks old. They then took her to DDU on Friday, where she died.The accused, who initially posed as a minor, was found to be 19 years old. He has been arrested. The girl’s parents and the youth’s father have been detained for questioning. A case of rape, culpable homicide and destroying evidence has been registered.

NEW DELHI: This is one burglary in which the key to success was locked, quite literally. Buoyed by their success in stealing an ATM in south Delhi on Friday, a gang dared to strike again on Sunday night. They stole an SUV from Naraina, uprooted an ATM of a government bank, put it in the vehicle and sped away. It took the robbers barely 7-10 minutes to steal the car and uproot the ATM, which had Rs 20 lakh in it.What they didn’t realise that the vehicle was fitted with a GPS device. When the owner was informed that his SUV had been stolen, he remotely switched off the engine. The puzzled thieves tried every trick in the book to switch on the ignition, but failed. They then abandoned the vehicle in RK Puram and fled.Harmender Singh (61), a transporter who lives in Rajouri Garden, was informed by his security guard that his white Bolero had been stolen from outside his office in Naraina. He told TOI, “I got the call around 2.20am. My son and I switched on the GPS and the vehicle was seen going towards Mayapuri. We informed police and told them we were going to follow the SUV.”The SUV was found going towards Delhi Cantonment from where it turned towards Dhaula Kuan. “When we started, we were 12 minutes away from my vehicle. By the time we crossed Moti Bagh, the time difference was just eight minutes. My employees then remotely switched off the SUV’s engine. We found it abandoned in Sector 13 RK Puram.”The father-son duo didn’t find anyone near the SUV. “We soon spotted something inside the boot. I called my driver to ask if he had kept anything there, but he replied in the negative. We then found the ATM along with ropes and spray paint. Soon, police reached and took over,” said Singh.In the meanwhile, police were informed that an ATM near a guesthouse in Naraina had been stolen. A guesthouse employee told police that when they stepped out after hearing noises, the robbers threatened to fire at them. “A case has been registered and teams have been formed to nab the accused,” said DCP (West) Deepak Purohit.",58	15	15	-1,1	0	0	0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/six-held-for-robbery-in-west-delhi/articleshow/71042763.cms	https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minor-pregnant-after-rape-dies-after-foetus-illegally-terminated-one-held/story-J49n9wiIUzvphXimKgtmWL.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/abortion-goes-awry-15-year-old-rape-survivor-dies-in-delhi/articleshow/71571718.cms	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gps-to-rescue-atm-robbers-locked-out-of-stolen-suv/articleshow/74199599.cms,77

The 45-day investigation revealed that the woman, Sheetal Mathur, was murdered allegedly after she did not agree to a marriage her family had arranged for her. Instead, she wanted to marry someone of her choice. Police said the family tried to pass off her death as natural. But the suspicion that she was murdered rose after the police received a tip that Sheetal’s body was being quietly cremated by her family members in Adarsh Nagar’s Lal Bagh on July 24. Suspecting foul play, a police team from Adarsh Nagar police station reached the Kewal Park cremation ground and stopped the cremation minutes before the pyre was to be lit. “Just three or four men had come for the cremation. When our team asked them how she had died, her father Lakhan Mathur, a cable TV operator, said she died of an illness. When asked for hospital records, he said she died in her sleep. Suspecting something amiss, the body was taken into custody and was sent to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital for an autopsy,” a police officer probing the case, who wished not to be named, said.Preliminary medical examination suggested that Sheetal’s body had external injuries on the neck and all over the body. “Almost a month later, when we got a detailed autopsy report, it mentioned multiple external injuries and stated that cause of death was asphyxia (suffocation) due to strangulation. All injuries were ante-mortem (suffered before death), the report said,” the officer said. A number of local residents, relatives and family members of the woman were questioned. Police learnt that the woman had strained relations with her family. “We learnt that Sheetal was in a relationship with a man from another caste and wanted to marry him. However, her family was against that,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said when police questioned Lakhan later, he continued to maintain that Sheetal had died in her sleep.“When asked why did they not rush her to a hospital or call the police, the man had no answer. We then confronted him with the post-mortem report and the statement of the other family members and relatives. Left with no choice, the man admitted to having killed her,” Arya said.The DCP said Lakhan took the help of his 30-year-old friend Raju Lal, also a cable TV operator, to carry out the crime. On July 23, when Sheetal went to sleep, they entered her room and strangled her. “They have been booked for murder under the IPC Section 302 and under Section 201 for tampering with evidence and giving false information. It took us more than a month to zero in on the suspects as we wanted to be sure about the cause of death and, therefore, waited for a detailed autopsy report. We are looking at the involvement of the other family members in the crime,” Arya said.	Sachin’s name has popped up in a bank robbery in Haryana

NEW DELHI: He was rewarded for proactive policing and called the best beat constable by the police commissioner last year, but Sachin turned rogue after being booked and suspended for raping a complainant and blackmailing her.After the constable’s name popped up in a sensational bank robbery in Haryana , his colleagues recalled that he was a part of a team that had solved a sensational robbery in 2018. In fact, he was an expert in tracking criminals. Delhi Police has now initiated dismissal proceedings against him.Police sources said that Sachin had joined the force eight years ago and was posted at Adarsh Nagar police station. He was allotted the beat around Jahangirpuri G-Block where he became a known face.In 2017, he had played a crucial role in tracking a gang of robbers who had targeted a businessman after which the area SHO and ACP had recommended him for recognition. A photo of him receiving a certificate from police commissioner Amulya Patnaik last year was also put up to set an example for others.However, a few months later Sachin’s reputation was sullied when a woman from Jahangirpuri approached Adarsh Nagar police station with a complaint of rape. She had approached Sachin with a personal dispute complaint. He took advantage of that and blackmailed and raped her on several occasions.Following the woman’s complaint, Sachin was suspended from service pending an inquiry. He was soon asked to join work. After serving a few months at the district lines, he was shifted to Motor Accidents Tribunal Cell early this year. However, he started remaining absent.“He had already turned rogue and was looking for ways to earn a quick buck. There were rumours about him trying to extort from local criminals. He had stopped contacting people from his batch,” said a former colleague on anonymity.Later, Haryana Police came with an inquiry at Adarsh Nagar police station with CCTV footage showing Sachin looting a bank locker. The cops also arrested two of Sachin’s relatives and recovered Rs 12 lakh of the Rs 5 crore robbed from the bank.Police said they are awaiting official intimation from Haryana Police so that they can initiate further action against Sachin.	NEW DELHI: A seven-year-old girl was lured with a promise of food and raped by a tea-stall owner in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar on Friday. The accused, who was known to the girl’s mother, allegedly took her to a makeshift room behind the stall and raped her.In her statement, the child told the cops that when she was returning from a government school nearby, the man, whom she referred to as maternal uncle, promised her lunch. She said he took her to a makeshift room, removed her clothes and forced himself on her. He then threatened her before letting her go.The girl claimed that she managed to reach the construction site where her mother worked and informed her about the incident, who then informed the police. The cops took the child for a medical examination where doctors confirmed sexual assault, following which the accused was detained from his shop.The girl told the cops that her mother had even asked the man to look after her until she returned from work. Her statement under CrPC Section 164 was recorded before a magistrate on Saturday.The mother told the cops that she and her daughter had shifted to Delhi from a village in eastern Uttar Pradesh and taken refuge at a colony where they met the accused, who was from the same village.",19	-1	7,0	1	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-who-tried-to-pass-off-death-of-daughter-as-natural-arrested-for-murder/story-LhlwvQLvhrVo8RekQXagwO.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-awarded-cop-turns-rogue-after-rape-suspension/articleshow/71641613.cms	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/promising-food-tea-seller-rapes-7-year-old-in-north-delhi/articleshow/71988631.cms,83

In the police complaint, his father alleged that he saw his neighbours beating the boy when he returned home after work. On enquiring, they alleged that the boy had stolen a mobile phone from their house. “Two more men came to the spot and began kicking and punching me. I fainted at the spot because of the beating,” the boy’s father stated in the first information report (FIR). He added that the men allegedly kidnapped his son. Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 53 police station, said, “We are trying to find the boy. No suspect has been arrested yet. We are investigating the case.”A case was registered under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 365 (kidnapping) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sector 53 police station on Friday.	Two men involved in over a dozen cases of robbery and snatching have been nabbed by the Special Cell of Delhi Police following a shootout at Wazirabad Burari road on Tuesday night, police said.

Police uniforms, two pistols and a motorcycle were seized from them.

The incident took place at around 10.15 pm when a police team stationed on Wazirabad-Burari road near Jagatpur flyover spotted a motorcycle coming from Wazirabad side and signalled it to stop but the bike-borne miscreants opened fire on police team, they said.

The duo fired four rounds, forcing police to retaliate resulting in one of the accused, later identified as Ravi (26) suffering bullet injury in his leg, they said.

The second accomplice, Mustakin (51) was apprehended unhurt, the police said.

The injured was admitted to a nearby hospital, a senior police official said.",13	-1,0	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/four-men-booked-for-kidnapping-and-beating-13-year-old-boy-in-wazirabad/story-HrFRVJgcgb6g51Af9jnkVK.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-involved-in-over-dozen-cases-of-robbery-in-up-delhi-nabbed-after-shootout-119101600025_1.html,89

According to the police, the accused, identified as Javed, was nabbed from North Delhi's Narela area. They have also seized one loaded country-made pistol from his possession, which was allegedly used to commission the crime.

""Considering the seriousness of the crime, many teams of Police were constituted by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP),"" the police said in a statement.

The 25-year-old was caught after the teams conducted raids at the ""possible hideouts"" of the accused at various places in New Delhi and Haryana.	The police on Sunday solved a murder case by arresting a criminal who was also wanted in seven other cases of murder.

""A team of special staff of Outer North district consisting of Sub Inspector Kamlesh, Assistant Sub Inspector Ombir, Head Constable Joginder, Constable Dinesh, Constable Hanuman and Constable Ravikant in the leadership of Inspector Ajay worked out the sensational murder case of Virender alias Kala with the arrest of one criminal Kapil Mann (25),"" DCP Outer North Delhi, Gaurav Sharma said.

Virender was killed after Mann fired at him indiscriminately near Sadabad in Narela.

The accused was carrying a reward of Rs 1,25,000 on his head. He has been arrested under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was wanted in eight cases of murder, attempt to murder and robbery etc.

He was arrested from Sector 34 area, near Kheda canal here.

Efforts are on to recover the weapon of offence. Further investigation is underway.	Fifteen months after he shot dead three rival gangsters on a busy road in north Delhi’s Burari, Jitender Gogi — one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters — has allegedly been named in the daring shootout in Narela on September 8 in which Virender Mann, a history sheeter, was killed. Police claimed that witnesses has identified one of the shooters as Jitender Gogi. Along with two aides, Gogi allegedly intercepted Mann’s car and pumped in 20 bullets in his body. Police said Gogi was last seenin Burari shootout in which a passeby woman was also killed. He had been on the run. With at least a dozen cases, including murder and extortion, Gogi carries a reward of Rs 4 lakh on his arrest. He was last arrested in 2016, but had fled police custody within three months. Police have also registered a case under the stringent MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) Act against him. Police officers who are trying to hunt Gogi down said he does not use one phone for long and changes his hideouts almost every other day. Police have in the past traced his location to Nepal and the other neighbouring states in north India. A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said booking Gogi under MCOCA means that on his arrest, he will not be bailed out easily and other criminals or associates sheltering him will also be booked. Further, the stringent law allows police to attach his properties acquired through illegal means, further weakening the activities of his gang, the officer said requesting anonymity.Gogi’s involvements have surfaced in crimes such as murders, attempts to murder, extortion, possession of illegal arms, carjacking and land grabbing.Investigation in several cases against the gangster shows that it was Gogi, his right hand Kuldeep Fajja and their gang member Rohit Moi who were involved in September 8 shoot out in which Virender Mann was killed. The trio’s name also surfaced in Burari shootings last year .Gogi was not always the most feared gangster. He was once a bright student at Delhi university. It was while studying in Swami Shraddhanand College that Gogi developed enmity with another student, Sunil alias Tillu, whose associates had allegedly beaten Gogi’s friend who was contesting college elections. The rival candidate was Tillu’s cousin. Gogi’s friend then withdrew his name and Tillu’s cousin won the elections.This incident gave birth to an alleged rivalry between Gogi and Tillu that has claimed more than 10 lives from both the groups over the past decade. While Gogi, last arrested in 2016 managed to flee from police custody, Tillu is currently in jail.	The murder of Virender Mann, former BSP MLA candidate from outer Delhi’s Narela, who succumbed to at least 20-25 gunshot wounds earlier this month, was allegedly orchestrated by Delhi’s most wanted gangster Jitender Gogi and his associate Kapil Mann, police said Monday. Police said they have arrested Kapil for the murder and said Virender’s killing was a retaliation against another murder last year — an associate of Neeraj Bawana had allegedly gunned down one Babloo Kheda, who was Kapil’s uncle.On September 8, five men had reportedly intercepted Virender’s Hyundai Creta on Lampur Road in Outer Delhi’s Narela and sprayed 30-40 bullets at his car, while he was seated beside the driver. As many as 20-25 bullets hit Virender, killing him on the spot, while his driver miraculously escaped the firing.Virender, who had contested the assembly elections from Narela on a BSP ticket in 2013 and lost, had 13 cases registered against him, including those of murder, attempt to murder, robberies, extortion and under the Arms Act.A senior police officer probing Virender’s murder said they got sketches of suspects made with the help of locals and witnesses and found that Gogi and Kapil, who carries a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest, were present at the spot of the crime during the shooting.DCP(outer north) Gaurav Sharma said their surveillance led police teams to an input that Kapil, a resident of Kheda Khurd village, will be reaching Sector 34 near the Kheda canal on Sunday. “On this input, our special staff team laid a trap and Kapil was arrested. He was carrying a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his arrest for his involvement in three murders, one attempt to murder, three robberies and one Arms Act case,” the DCP said.Sharma said during questioning, Kapil disclosed that on September 8, he and his men were tailing Virender’s car and when they saw Virender’s car stuck in a traffic jam, he and his associates fired indiscriminately at that vehicle. “Efforts to arrest the other suspects are being made. Among the other suspects, we have so far identified Kuldeep Fajja, who is Gogi’s confidant, and gang member Rohit Moi,” the DCP said.Another officer associated with the investigation said further interrogation of the arrested men revealed that Virender’s killing was the fallout of a murder that took place last year.“On July 31, 2018, 46-year-old Babloo Kheda was gunned down in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar. One Parvesh Mann, who was backed by gangster Neeraj Bawana, was the prime suspect. Later, in October, police arrested Parvesh Mann. Investigations revealed that the car in which he was arrested had been given to him by Virender. Kapil, the nephew of Babloo Kheda, came to know that Virender also had a role in his uncle’s murder. He told us that Virender was killed to settle scores with Bawana for plotting his uncle’s death,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.	Greater Noida: A fake robbery and misbehaviour with a journalist turned the Dankaur police station into a protest site on Wednesday. First, a tractor driver allegedly made off with farmers’ money he claimed had been stolen. Then, a journalist who was covering the case was allegedly manhandled by a sub inspector.It started with Deepak Singh, 23, who was on his way back from a grain market in Delhi’s Narela after selling wheat on behalf of several farmers. Around 9.20am, Mukesh Tayal, the tractor owner, got a call from Deepak, telling him that the bag with Rs 6,7 lakh in cash had been looted by three men on a bike who overpowered him near Sports City. At 9.30am, police arrived at the spot. “Deepak claimed only Rs 4,000 was looted,” a senior police officer told TOI. Then, Tayal got there. Meanwhile, CCTV footage showed no bike around the tractor along the stretch. Police started searching the tractor and said Deepak fled during the search, while Tayal alleged they had deliberately let him go. Around 11am, Anshu Chauhan, a local journalist, reached to cover the case. “I was at Dankaur police station to find out about the case. I was sitting near a staircase when sub-inspector Dinesh Kumar started arguing with me, snatched my phone and smashed it. He thought I was trying to take a video. When I told him I was not, he held me by the collar,” Chauhan said.The news spread, a group of mediapersons told the Dankaur SHO what happened. But before he could arrive, local journalist Mustkin Khan said, constable clerk Pappu Khan abused them and threatened to jail them. The place then turned into a site of two protests – one by journalists and another by farmers, who had converged there demanding their money. Deepak was finally arrested near Palwal around 6am on Wednesday. The farmers were still on protest till late evening.An FIR has been lodged against Deepak for criminal breach of trust, SP (rural) Ranvijay Singh said. Tayal, however, told TOI he and another farmer spoke to Deepak, who said he had handed the money to the police. Singh said that the constable clerk had been transferred earlier. No action has been taken against the sub-inspector as of now.	GREATER NOIDA: A wanted member of the Randeep Bhati gang was arrested on Thursday for allegedly robbing two truck drivers at gunpoint in the name of ""local tax"" .Ashok Kumar, from Dabra, and two others, Yatendra Lala and another person, allegedly stopped two trucks on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on Wednesday.Driver Dharmveer said the incident took place at 10.45am when he and another driver were going to deliver goods in Narela. ""We were entering the expressway from Rampur Fatehpur side when three men came in a car and stopped our trucks. They asked us to pay Rs 2,000 for each truck as 'local tax',"" he said.

MEERUT: A day before an 18-year-old rape survivor was to testify in a court in Delhi’s Rohini area, her family in Baghpat ’s Bijrol village found a note pasted outside their house, threatening them that the girl will face a fate worse than the Unnao victim’s if she appeared before the court.“If she testifies in court on December 13, consequences will not be good. They may be worse than what happened in Unnao,” the note read.Even during an earlier court hearing, the accused had harassed the survivor so much that she had to be admitted to a Delhi hospital and could not make it to the court, her father said.Acting swiftly, the local police filed an FIR and arrested the accused on Thursday.Baghpat superintendent of police Gopendra Yadav said, “We arrested Soran Singh , 30, during the early hours of Thursday on the basis of the complaint made by the survivor’s father. He has been charged with criminal intimidation.”According to police, the survivor used to stay with her father, a taxi driver, in Delhi’s Burari area for coaching in 2018 when she came in contact with Singh, who belonged to her village in Baghpat.In July 2018, Singh took her to a vacant flat in Mukherjee Nagar on the pretext of providing her with notes for her studies, spiked her drink and allegedly raped her. He also filmed the act and began to blackmail her into submission. Unable to continue with repeated sexual abuse, she filed a police complaint in Delhi.Singh was booked under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison with an intent to commit offence). According to the FIR and chargesheet, Soran was arrested on July 11, 2018 but was released on bail on July 30 the same year. Ever since, Soran had been pressuring the family for a compromise.“My daughter is terrified as the accused continues to haunt our family. He has accosted me many a time and even threatened my daughter when she had gone to appear in her exams in a local college. He hounded my daughter so badly the last time that she had to be admitted to Delhi’s St. Stephens Hospital because of trauma and could not make it to the court hearing,” the survivor’s father said.	A 22-year-old man was arrested for allegedly committing burglary at a house in southeast Delhi's Lajpat Nagar, police said on Sunday.

The accused, Manoj Singh, is a native of Uttarakhand's Champawat district and was living in a rented house in north Delhi's Burari. He was arrested on Friday, they said.

On February 4, police received a complaint from one Agender Kumar about a burglary at his house. The lock on the main door of his house had been broken to gain entry, the police said.

Singh was seen in the footage of a CCTV camera installed near Kumar's house. He was seen carrying a black bag and was later identified through face recognition app, they said.

On the basis of technical surveillance, the police raided Singh's residence in Champawat's Kaknai village and arrested him, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.

Stolen jewellery and cash worth approximately Rs 25 lakh was recovered from him, he said.

During interrogation, Singh told police he wanted to have a lavish lifestyle and was fond of premium whiskey. He often used to visit bars and cafes in Hauz Khas village and Paharganj, he added.

Singh was unemployed and committed burglaries to earn easy money. He has spent thousands of rupees of the stolen money in bars, Meena said.

He looked for houses in colonies and residential societies which would be locked in the day. He stole cash and jewellery but never things like mobile phones and laptops, fearing they could be traced, he said.

He was previously involved in five cases of burglaries, the DCP said.",-1	-1	18	22,0	0	0	1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gogi-killer-who-returned-a-year-after-4-murders/story-P0anBo8ecjBXY6J1rkUtnN.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-involved-in-over-dozen-cases-of-robbery-in-up-delhi-nabbed-after-shootout-119101600025_1.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accused-warns-rape-survivor-of-fate-worse-than-unnao-victims/articleshow/72499214.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/man-arrested-for-burglary-in-southeast-delhi-120021600665_1.html,77

In January, the Delhi High Court disposed of Sharma's plea seeking premature release from the prison.

Sidharth Vashisht alias Manu Sharma is serving a life term in Tihar Jail for murdering Jessica Lal in 1999.

Jessica's sister Sabrina Lall had written a letter to Tihar Jail for Sharma's early release, saying that she had no objection to his release.

Jessica was shot by Manu when she refused to serve liquor to him at Tamarind Court restaurant, owned by socialite and designer Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on April 29, 1999.

Manu Sharma is the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma.	The wife of Manu Sharma, a convict in Jessica Lal murder case, on Wednesday approached the Human Right Commission (NHRC) for his release, alleging human rights violation.

Manu's wife Preity Sharma through her advocate Amit Sahni approached the NHRC, alleging the gross violation of her husband's human rights.

She has claimed that her husband had been illegally detained for more than the prescribed period of incarceration (20 years with remission) as per the prevalent policy of the state.

""The policy clearly reads that cases falling in Clause 3.1 of the SRB order such as her husband's case should not be detained for more than 20 years with remission and having fulfilled all the parameters as laid down in the state policy of the government and as per recommendations of the NHRC guidelines,"" she has stated in her plea.

Manu Sharma, originally Siddharth Vashisht, is serving life term for murdering model Jessica Lal in 1999.

His detention beyond the maximum prescribed period in a whimsical and arbitrary manner tantamount to illegal and unlawful detention and is violative of his basic human rights as enriched in Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, she further said.

Preity submitted that Delhi's Sentence Review Board (SRB) rejected Sharma's plea for premature release for ""extraneous reasons on four occasions"" even as he fulfills all factors which are to be considered to make a decision.

She said that the board extended benefit of ""premature release to convicts who were involved in much more serious offences and who did not even fulfill the prescribed parameters"" and alleged ""malpractice and violation"" of law in the decision making which, she said, was in complete ""violation of constitutional rights and human rights of my husband.""

Advocate Sahni urged the NHRC to protect the human rights of Manu Sharma by passing appropriate directions to ""uphold the law and stop the blatant violation of his human rights being done without having sufficient cause.""

Manu Sharma is the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma.	Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma, who has spent about 17 years in jail, has sought premature release and the Delhi High Court Friday asked the Delhi government to respond to his plea.

A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal asked the Delhi government to file its reply on the petition in which Sharma has challenged the July 19 decision of Sentence Review Board (SRB) rejecting his case for release.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on December 16.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Sharma, sought his release while relying on the high court's judgement by which Tandoor murder case convict Sushil Sharma was granted premature release.

""The petitioner qualifies all the requisite parameters as stipulated in minutes of meetings of SRB. Further incarceration of the petitioner after completion of maximum prescribed period, that is, 20 years (including remission), in absence of cogent and compelling reasons, is unlawful and without legal justification,"" said the plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni.

""The recommendations dated July 19, 2019 of SRB rejecting the case of petitioner for pre-mature release is contrary to law and not based on facts and is liable to be set aside,"" it said.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra said for the last three years, Sharma was in semi-open jail and now he is in open jail. He said it has been held by the Supreme Court that life imprisonment means till natural life.

Sharma said in his plea SRB has rejected the plea in an arbitrary and impartial manner and even earlier also, the authorities have rejected his plea on three occasions.

Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.

The trial court had acquitted him, but the Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.

Lal was shot dead by Manu Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at the Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli area on the night of April 30, 1999.	The Delhi High Court on Friday issued a notice to the state government on a plea filed by Manu Sharma, the convict in 1999 Jessica Lal murder case, seeking his release.

A division bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal granted four weeks to file a response on the petition of Siddharth Vashisht, also known as Manu Sharma. The court will take up the matter on December 16.

Sharma is serving life term for murdering Jessica Lal in south Delhi's Mehrauli in April, 1999.

The Delhi government sought time to file its response on Sharma's petition, which was filed through advocate Amit Sahni.

Sharma has completed almost 23 years (with remission) and 17 years (without remission) in jail, the petition said, adding that he is aggrieved by the Delhi government's September 19 order upholding the recommendation of Sentence Review Board (SRB), which decides on the release of prisoners sentenced for life.

The board had rejected Sharma's petition for early release on July 19 this year.

The petition said the board had rejected Sharma's petition in spite of fulfilling ""all required parameters"" and called its decision as ""unfair, arbitrary impartial"".

""This is not for the first time, that the SRB has chosen to reject the petitioner's case for release, earlier too on three occasions, the case of the petitioner has been rejected by SRB in an unfair manner for extraneous reasons, despite fulfilling all required parameters and prescribed conditions,"" it submitted.

It said, ""Aggrieved by the earlier rejection order the Manu stated that his rejection is unreasoned and cryptic manner which were contrary to the facts on record in an unfair and biased manner.""

In September this year, Sharm's wife, Preity Sharma, had approached the Human Rights Commission (NHRC) alleging that gross violation of Human Rights and stated that her husband is illegally detained for more than the prescribed period of incarceration (20 years with remission).

Jessica was shot by Sharma, the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma, when she refused to serve him liquor at Tamarind Court restaurant at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on April 29, 1999.

NEW DELHI: Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma on Friday moved Delhi high court challenging the rejection of his plea for premature release by the Sentence Review Board (SRB) of the state government.A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal asked the Delhi government to file its reply on the petition by Sharma against the July 19 decision of the SRB rejecting his case for release.Sharma, who has spent nearly 17 years in jail, has cited the HC verdict on Tandoor murder case convict Sushil Sharma who was granted premature release.""The petitioner qualifies all the requisite parameters as stipulated in minutes of meetings of SRB. Further incarceration of the petitioner after completion of maximum prescribed period, that is, 20 years (including remission), in absence of cogent and compelling reasons, is unlawful and without legal justification,"" said the plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni. ""The recommendations dated July 19, 2019 of SRB rejecting the case of petitioner for pre-mature release is contrary to law and not based on facts and is liable to be set aside,"" it added.However, prosecution opposed the plea arguing that for the last three years, Sharma was in semi-open jail and now he is in open jail and it has been held by the Supreme Court that life imprisonment means till natural life.But the convict questioned the rejection by SRB, arguing that it has been done in an arbitrary manner and even earlier, the authorities had rejected his plea on three occasions.Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lall in 1999.The trial court had acquitted him, but Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.Lall was shot dead by Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at the Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli on the night of April 30, 1999.	The Delhi High Court directed the jail authorities on Monday to decide within a week the plea of Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma, who has spent about 17 years in jail, seeking eight weeks parole to look after family needs.

Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar was informed by the counsel for Sharma that his plea seeking parole is pending with the authorities for nearly nine months whereas they are required to decide it within four weeks.

""The jail authorities are directed to dispose of the parole plea of the petitioner (Sharma) within a week,"" the court said.

Senior advocate Pradeep Nandrajog and lawyer Amit Sahni, appearing for Sharma, submitted that he be released on parole for eight weeks for continuity of social ties and to look after family ties 



They said the plea is pending before the jail authorities for nearly nine months and they are not deciding it and he is challenging the inordinate delay.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra said Sharma should first wait for the decision of jail authorities on his plea and thereafter, approach high court, if required.

He said Sharma is already in an open jail which means that from morning till sunset, he goes to his work outside the boundaries of jail.

To this, the judge said, ""but he can't be roaming around during this period."" 



Sharma has been in confinement for more than 16 years and 6 months in jail and over 22 years and 8 months, including the remission, earned by him on account of good conduct and work done by him in prison.

His counsel said as per the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, a convict can avail parole for a maximum of eight weeks in two spells in a conviction year.

As Sharma has not availed any parole this year, he is entitled to eight weeks, he said, adding that if the parole is not granted timely, it will lapse at the end of the year.

Sharma's another plea seeking pre-mature release is also pending in the high court which had earlier sought response of Delhi government on it.

In that petition, he has challenged the July 19 decision of Sentence Review Board (SRB) rejecting his case for release.

Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.

The trial court had acquitted him, but the Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.

Lal was shot dead by Manu Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at the Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli area on the night of April 30, 1999.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court asked the AAP government on Thursday to reply to a plea by Jessica Lal murder convict Manu Sharma , serving life imprisonment, seeking premature release.Justice Brijesh Sethi asked the Delhi government to file a status report in the matter along with the relevant records of Sentence Review Board (SRB).The court listed the matter for further hearing on March 30.Sharma has sought direction to set aside the September 19, 2019 order of the competent authority which had accepted the July 19 last year recommendations of SRB rejecting his early release plea.The petition, filed through advocate Amit Sahni, sought Sharma's release saying the authorities rejected his plea in an unfair, arbitrary and whimsical manner.It contended that Sharma was being victimised by the State and despite having undergone 23 years (with remission) in jail, his case was rejected four times. It claimed that he has been rewarded appreciations for his efforts through his NGO “Siddhartha Vashishtha Cheritable Trust”.""The petitioner (Sharma) has had an unblemished record throughout incarceration and there has been nothing adverse against him. His reformative actions and efforts for helping children of jail inmates has been appreciated by the Lt. Governor of Delhi as well as the Division Bench of High Court of Delhi,"" the plea said.Sharma, son of former Union minister Venod Sharma , was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the high court in December, 2006 for killing Jessica Lal in 1999.The trial court had acquitted him, but the Delhi High Court had reversed the order and the Supreme Court had upheld his life sentence in April, 2010.Lal was shot dead by Sharma after she had refused to serve him liquor at Tamarind Court restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani at Qutub Colonnade in south Delhi's Mehrauli area on the night of April 30, 1999.	Delhi High Court on Thursday asked Delhi government to file its reply on a petition filed by Siddharth Vashishatha, also known as Manu Sharma, who is serving a life term for murdering Jessica Lal in South Delhi's Mehrauli in April 1999, seeking premature release from Tihar Jail.

Justice Brijesh Sethi issued a notice to the Delhi government and listed the matter for March 30.

The court also asked the government to submit its response with the entire original record, reports of all departments regarding the conduct of the petitioner, which were considered by the Sentence Review Board (SRB) for considering the release.

Sharma has sought to set aside a Delhi Government order dated September 19, 2019, accepting the recommendations of SRB dated July 19, 2019 (qua the petitioner) and for issuing an appropriate direction to release of the petitioner, as the respondent rejected the case in an unfair, arbitrary and whimsical manner.

In a petition filed through advocate Amit Sahni, Sharma told the court that he has spent more than 23 years in jail with remission.

""At the time of the offence (in 1999), the Petitioner was 24-years-old and has spent most of his adult life in jail. The petitioner has a wife and old aged parents who are well above 70 years of age. During his incarceration, he has tried to make amends and do penance by diligently working in the jail and for other jail inmates,"" the plea said.

""Over the last 20 years the petitioner has worked in the jail factory, horticulture, and education division and the same has been appreciated by way of certificates and letters of commendation by successive Superintendents, DIG (prisons) and DG (prisons) on numerous occasions. The petitioner has had an unblemished record throughout incarceration and there has been nothing adverse against him,"" it added.

The petitioner said that his reformative actions and efforts for helping children of jail inmates have been appreciated by the Governor of Delhi as well as the Division Bench of High Court of Delhi.

The petitioner said that after completing his sentence and conducting himself in the most disciplined manner throughout his incarceration and keeping a positive attitude towards reform and preforming all works and tasks assigned to him, the petitioner now finds himself in a position where even after fulfilling all the parameters as per the prevalent policy/order the release of the petitioner has been rejected on four separate occasions in an unfair and unlawful manner.

The siblings had hired a killer from Darjeeling in West Bengal who travelled all the way to Delhi and hid for a few days in a Paharganj hotel waiting for the opportune moment to strike.The woman, Anita, had created an alibi of visiting a friend in Greater Noida on Saturday and left the door open for the killer to enter and stab the man, Sunil. The killer and Anita’s brother were caught from Kalimpong in Darjeeling district.Sunil was found with a stab wound on his throat. Anita had earlier told police that when she returned from Greater Noida on Sunday morning, she found Sunil dead. She then informed the landlord to call the PCR.DCP (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said Anita’s alibi started falling apart during questioning. She gave different versions of the purpose of her visit to Greater Noida. She finally confessed to having plotted Sunil’s murder as he was refusing to let her go despite their differences.It was found that Anita was married, but was staying with Sunil. When she told him about returning to her hometown, Sunil fought with her and allegedly started blackmailing her to stay back. Anita told her brother, Bijay Chhetri, who stays in Kalimpong, about her predicament. Chhetri then roped in his friend, Rajendra, to kill Sunil.Around 4am on Sunday, Chhetri and Rajendra stabbed Sunil and left for Anand Vihar. They stopped on the way and threw the knife in a bush. They boarded a train for Kolkata and then returned to Kalimpong. Police nabbed then from a remote locality where they were hiding at a friend’s house. The knife used in the murder has been recovered.

The accused were identified as Fatima (34), her husband Mohmood (37), both residents of Sarai Kale Khan, and Mohammad Zakir (35), resident of Taimoor Nagar, they said.

According to the police, the two men conspired and planned to target vacant houses during day-time, while Fatima, who worked as domestic help in the residential areas of Lajpat Nagar, conducted recce and passed information to them.

On September 29, police said they received a complaint about theft of Rs 50 lakhs, diamond and gold jewellery along with expensive wrist watch and other valuable articles from a house at National Park area, Lajpat Nagar, and a case was registered at Amar Colony police station.

The accused were seen in a CCTV footage leaving the spot in an e-rickshaw after committing the burglary, the police said.

On Tuesday, a raid was conducted at Taimoor Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan areas and the accused were arrested, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal.

Later, Fatima was also arrested in connection with the incident, the officer said.

Stolen cash amounting to Rs 31.91 lakh, gold and diamond jewellery, laptop, mobile, e-rickshaw and tools were recovered from them, the officer added.

Nakul and Kapil are suspected of gunning down 52-year-old Narender alias Ninty who had allegedly slapped Kapil’s brother in July, said a police officer not authorised to speak to the media. The murder is suspected to be a fallout of that incident. Nakul Sangwan alias Deepak, a permanent resident of Mahendragarh in Haryana, has cases of murder, attempts to murder and illegal possession of arms registered against him. He was also arrested in a murder case last year and was released from jail in June 2019.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that they received information at Dwarka North police station on Tuesday reporting that a man was shot outside his office in Kakrola village at around 4 pm.

Accused Says They Got Thrashed At Cafe

NEW DELHI: The sensational murder of a property dealer turned politician, who was shot dead in Dwarka on Tuesday by two assailants in a daring attack captured on CCTV camera, was a fallout of a fight that took place in a cafe run by the victim, police said after arresting one of the alleged shooters on Thursday.The victim, Narendra Gehlot, had contested the last municipal elections as an independent and lost. He had slapped the shooter, Nakul Sangwan, at his cafe after locking him up following an altercation, police said. Sangwan, who is the cousin of gangster Kapil Sangwan, was nursing a grudge against Gehlot ever since, and decided to eliminate him to avenge the insult, police added.Police arrested Sangwan near Dwarka on Thursday after laying a trap. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said a team led by ACP Rajinder Singh confronted Sangwan near Goyla Dairy. When he saw the police team, Sangwan tried to whip out his pistol and fire but was overpowered by the team. The .32 bore pistol he had used for the murder was recovered from him.Cops found that Sangwan was earlier involved in another murder in Aman Vihar near Rohini. The victim was a youth named Pushkar, whom Sangwan suspected of passing on information to his rivals about the movement of the family members of one of his associates. That murder too was captured in a CCTV camera.During interrogation, Sangwan told the cops that in July this year, he and his friend Rohit had gone to a cafe run by Gehlot’s relatives on the third floor of his office near Dwarka More. Rohit had a running dispute with Gehlot and his relative, claiming that he had lent them money for the cafe which Gehlot had refused to return.Finding them sitting in the cafe, Gehlot challenged them which led to an argument during which he allegedly shut the door and called in a few of his employees to thrash Sangwan and Rohit. Angered by the insult, Sangwan was looking for an oppurtunity to take revenge and had kept a watch outside Gehlot’s shop to track his movements, police said.On Tuesday, he and one of his associates waylaid Gehlot while he was leaving his shop, and started firing at his car. When Gehlot tried to flee, Sangwan climbed on a car parked near Gehlot’s car and shot him dead.Sangwan told cops that he had dropped out of a Haryana college while pursuing a BSc course. He was inspired by his cousin Kapil, who has been absconding for the past few years. He had joined Kapil’s gang and was a notorious sharpshooter of the Nandu gang. He was arrested last year in a murder case at Baba Haridass Nagar, and was released from the jail in June 2019. Sangwan had started extorting money from businessmen in Dwarka and adjoning areas.Police are now on the lookout for his associate, who had also fired at Gehlot.	Four people involved in several cases of extortion and murder were arrested after a brief exchange of fire in Dwarka's Chhawla area, police said on Tuesday.

The accused have been identified as Gulshan Khati (23), Amit Gulia (25), Krishan Kumar (30) and Anil Bhattar (25).

While Khati, Gulia and Kumar are residents of Najfgarh, Bhattar hails from Jhajjar district in Haryana, they said.

""On Monday, the police arrested the accused near Chhawla stand in Najafgarh at around 5:40 PM after a brief exchange of fire.

""All the accused were sharpshooters. Four pistols, 23 live cartridges, one car and a bike were recovered from their possession,"" said Anto Alphonse, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka).

Khati, Kumar and Gulia were involved in separate cases and were lodged in jail. They had got interim bail but had not surrendered, police said.

Bhattar was arrested in connection with a murder and robbery case in Haryana in 2010. He remained in jail for nine years and was just released nine days ago, they added.	Delhi Police on Tuesday said that a team of Anti-Auto Theft Squad (AATS) arrested four men who were involved in several extortion and murder cases after a brief exchange of fire.

Four pistols and 23 live cartridges were also seized from the arrested.

The encounter took place on September 30.

While addressing the press, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Anto Alphonse said, ""Four criminals were arrested and three sophisticated pistols, one country-made pistol and 23 live cartridges recovered along with one Fortuner car and one robbed Enfield Bullet Motorcycle.""

""As a part of the commitment to fight crime, AATS of Dwarka district was tracking the criminals in the area. On September 30, the team swung into action immediately after they received the information and laid a trap near Chhawla Stand, Najafgarh. The criminals fired upon police when asked to surrender so police in their defence retaliated,"" the DCP added.

Later, all four accused were arrested. Efforts are being made to arrest their associate, who is on the run after jumping his interim bail in June this year.	A wanted criminal, who was allegedly planning to murder his uncle over a property dispute, was arrested from west Delhi, police said on Saturday.

The accused, Arun Kumar (28), a resident of Gurgaon, was previously involved in eight criminal cases, they said.

""On Thursday, police got a tip-off regarding Kumar and arrested him from Dichaon village,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said.

During interrogation, Kumar told police that he was planning to kill his uncle as he had misappropriated his father's share in an ancestral land. He was looking for an accomplice who could assist him, he said.

A country-made pistol with two live cartridges were recovered from the accused, the police said.

Kumar was a member of the Raju Basodiya group. In February this year, he and his associates had attacked a team of Haryana Police and rescued a criminal, Sandeep Jetharia, from custody, they said.	Political leaders, jurists and Bollywood celebrities on Friday joined the family of Nirbhaya to call for plugging loopholes in the rape laws to ensure those on death row for this crime are not allowed to ""manipulate"" the legal system for delaying the execution.

As reactions poured from all sections of the society that justice has finally been done to the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who later came to be known as 'Nirbhaya', the fearless one, her parents said they will study the loopholes found during their seven-year-long legal struggle and prepare a list with the help of their lawyers and well-wishers.

Four men - Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) - convicted of the gang-rape and murder of Nirbhaya in December 2012 in Delhi were hanged at 5.30 am inside Tihar Jail.

Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said justice was delayed but not denied while father Badrinath Singh said although his daughter has got justice, the family will now fight for daughters of the country and work to plug the loopholes in the rape laws.

""We will request the Supreme Court to issue guidelines so that no one can adopt delaying tactics in such cases in future,"" said Asha Devi.

""Justice has been delivered finally, but after much delay. Our fight to ensure timely justice to other such women victims will continue, and hope the system will ensure fast-tracked courts for speedy justice,"" she told reporters at her home in Dwarka in west Delhi.

Nirbhaya's father said the entire world knows she has finally got justice but he does not think everyone will.

""Today, Nirbhaya has got justice and message has gone across the country that those who indulge in such heinous crimes will not be spared. But we need to take forward this struggle. We want to study the loopholes during our seven-year-long legal struggle,"" he added.

He said the family will consult their lawyers, well-wishers and other well-meaning people. ""They will study the case and prepare a list of the loopholes in the system. We will give it to the government and tell them to make necessary changes."" 



Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Friday was a day of satisfaction with Nirbhaya getting justice, but also time to introspect whether death row convicts could be allowed to ""manipulate"" the system to delay execution.

""It's a day of satisfaction that a daughter, who underwent so much pain, has got justice,"" Prasad told reporters in Parliament premises.

""It's time for judiciary, government and civil society to introspect whether death row convicts can be allowed to manipulate system and cause delay."" 



Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said there is a need to ensure that police investigations are completed in a swift manner, adding there is also a need to change the judicial system so that in such cases, victims do not have to wait for seven long years but get justice within six months.

This whole Nirbhaya case shows the number of loopholes we have in our judicial system, which gives the people a free hand in delaying justice for seven years, he added.

Retired Supreme Court judge N Santosh Hegde expressed concern that it took a ""long-time"" to give effect to the apex court's final judgement in the Nirbhaya case and called for steps to curb the misuse of the system.

""... the time taken to ultimately give effect to the final judgement of the Supreme Court gives rise to some sort of a thinking in the mind of the people: is justice really functioning?"" Hegde told PTI.

""Because ultimately when the highest court gives a verdict and constitution of law provides one review -- may be a mercy petition before the President, you (the convicts) make a joke out of that. There were multiple petitions"", he noted.

Hegde said there should be some system to prevent ""such misuse"", adding he does not buy the argument that everybody has a right to challenge it as long as it's permissible in law.

Bollywood celebrities including Rishi Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu and Ritiesh Deshmukh called for stricter laws for crime against women in India.

""Jaisi karni waisi bharni (you reap what you sow). Let this set an example not only in India but world over. Punishment for rape is by death. You have to respect womanhood. Shame on the people who delayed the execution. Jai Hind!,"" Kapoor wrote on Twitter.

Actor Raveena Tandon also demanded swift justice in such cases in future.

""The planet is less 4 monsters. 8 long years, the parents have waited for justice. High time we demand swift justice,"" she wrote on the microblogging site.

Actor Preity Zinta tweeted, ""Finally the #Nirbhayacase comes to an end. I wish it would have been faster but I'm happy it's over. Finally she & her parents are in peace. #RIPNirbhaya #Justicedelayed #TookTooLong."" 



""If #Nirbhaya rapists were hung in 2012 the judicial system would have stopped so much crime against women. Fear of the law would have kept the lawless in check. Prevention is always better than cure. It's time the Indian govt takes steps for judicial reforms. #RIPNirbhaya."" 



Echoing similar sentiments, Riteish said, ""Stricter law enforcement, harsher punishment & fast courts for quick justice is the only way to instil fear in monsters who even think of such heinous acts. #JusticeForNirbhaya... The wait has been long but the justice has been served."" 



Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani said it has taken long time for Nirbhaya's parents to get justice but it has been done finally.

Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal said time has come to create a strong system for a speedy punishment of heinous crime convicts.

National Commission for Women (NCW) chief Rekha Sharma said the Nirbhaya case has revealed loopholes in the legal system which the four convicts took advantage of.",-1	-1	23	-1	-1	-1	-1	23,0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/man-arrested-two-juveniles-apprehended-in-connection-with-burglaries-at-delhis-dwarka-shops/articleshow/71294965.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/man-arrested-two-juveniles-apprehended-in-connection-with-burglaries-at-dwarka-shops-119092500636_1.html	https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/23-yr-old-held-for-dwarka-property-dealer-murder/story-lzoiwvWo5L0XKQxS7lAHNJ.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cafe-fight-led-to-businessmans-murder-in-dwarka-cops/articleshow/71320848.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/police-arrest-four-people-involved-in-several-cases-of-extortion-and-murder-119100101037_1.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/4-arrested-by-delhi-police-for-involvement-in-extortion-murder-cases-119100100829_1.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/police-arrest-wanted-criminal-in-delhi-foil-murder-plot-120031500043_1.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/pol-leaders-jurists-bollywood-join-nirbhaya-family-to-call-for-plugging-loopholes-in-rape-laws-120032001072_1.html,53

Nakul and Kapil are suspected of gunning down 52-year-old Narender alias Ninty who had allegedly slapped Kapil’s brother in July, said a police officer not authorised to speak to the media. The murder is suspected to be a fallout of that incident. Nakul Sangwan alias Deepak, a permanent resident of Mahendragarh in Haryana, has cases of murder, attempts to murder and illegal possession of arms registered against him. He was also arrested in a murder case last year and was released from jail in June 2019.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that they received information at Dwarka North police station on Tuesday reporting that a man was shot outside his office in Kakrola village at around 4 pm. He was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.A CCTV footage of the attack was also widely shared on social media in which a man with his face cover is seen shooting at Narender as he got into his car. The video shows Narender trying to flee but assailant chases him and shot him repeatedly.Alphonse said they had registered a case of murder on the complaint of aa person named Pradeep Dhaka, a relative of Narender, who was also an eye witness to the murder. “Preliminary probe revealed that Dhaka owned a café on the top floor of Narender’s office building. We came to know that a few months back a quarrel took place at the café between Narender and Nakul Sangwan. During the scuffle, Narender had even slapped Nakul Sangwan and thrashed some of his aides,” the DCP said.He said they began a looking into Nakul Sangwan and within hours, they got information that he would come to Sector 18 in Dwarka on a motorcycle on Wednesday.“On this input, a team laid trap and soon as Nakul was spotted, our team asked him to surrender. Seeing the police, the man took out his pistol and tried to shoot at the team, but was overpowered in time. A loaded pistol was recovered from him. The motorcycle he was using was also found to be stolen from Dwarka,” the officer said.“He said he was miffed after Narender slapped him and wanted to revenge. We have also identified the other assailant and efforts to identify him are underway,” he said.

Delhi Police are in the middle of an extremely rare respite from all kinds of crime starting March 22, when stringent measures were put in place to stave off the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), before a nationwide lockdown took effect three days later. The police maintaining a higher profile outdoors to enforce the lockdown, and fear of the virus, has helped. Not a single case of abduction (of adults) or extortion has been reported since the lockdown. Crimes such as robbery, snatching, kidnapping (of minors) and theft have dropped significantly compared to the situation before the police and the state government enforced the complete lockdown in Delhi on March 22, when the nation observed a “Janta Curfew” on the Prime Minister’s call. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn March 22, Delhi Police imposed prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, banning the assembly of four or more persons across the city. It was the first time in four decades that prohibitory orders had been issued for the whole capital city. On March 25, the three-week nationwide lockdown kicked in.The city police’s crime data in the three weeks (March 1 to March 21) before the lockdown period and after that(March 22 to March 31), accessed by Hindustan Times, shows that there has been an unprecedened reduction in all types of crime across the city. Sample this – between March 1 and March 21, 63 persons died in road accidents. At least 1,600 road accident deaths are reported each year – an average of around four deaths every day. The number of road accident deaths in Delhi each year is at least three times the level in Mumbai and Bengaluru. But between March 22 and March 31, there were only eight deaths. Public and most private transport vehicles have gone off the roads for the duration of the lockdown, explaining the dip.There is a dip in vehicle thefts too – on an average around 140 vehicles are stolen every day. Between March 1 and 21, 2486 vehicles were reported stolen, but after the prohibitory orders came into force, the vehicle stolen data was 409.There has been a significant drop in kidnappings -- at least 100 abductions are reported every week in Delhi. There were 325 cases in the first three weeks of March but after March 21, the total number of kidnappings reported was 43. While the city reports around 2,000 abduction cases every year, there has not been a single case of abduction since March 22(Between March 1 and 21, there were 29 abduction cases). “The numbers are coming down for the first time in decades. Let me give you an example. Kidnapping cases in Delhi are usually of minor girls who are kidnapped by their friends or neighbours. That also includes many cases of elopement. Now with everyone home and people practising social distancing, kidnapping cases have come down drastically,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said .Incidents of snatching, one of the most common crimes in Delhi, has decreased for the first time. There are typically around 150 snatching cases every week – there were 474 cases between March 1 and March 21 -- but after March 22, police have recorded only 49.With traffic thin and the roads empty, some criminals do go about their work. Rakesh Rana, a cinematographer from Kakrola had just stepped out of an ATM kiosk in Outer Delhi after withdrawing money when the city’s infamous bike-borne snatchers struck. “It was dark when I left the ATM. Two men on a motorcycle came out of nowhere and snatched my cell phone. All shops in the area were closed so there were no people around. Those bikers took advantage of the dark and the open road. Before I could react, they were gone. The empty roads helped them flee,” he said. Lawbreakers have also turned to new ways of committing crimes.On Friday, a milkman was arrested in South Avenue for allegedly smuggling liquor inside milk canisters. All liquor shops are closed in Delhi. Borders have also been sealed. Within Delhi, only those supplying essential services and products (milk included) are exempted from prohibitory orders. A police officer who is probing the case said, “The man is a Bulandshahr resident and was smuggling liquor posing as a milkman. He had the milk canisters fitted on his bike. He even managed to cross police barricades without being stopped. He had bought the liquor from Haryana and had planned to sell it in Uttar Pradesh.”Perhaps Delhi’s situation can be best described by a viral photograph on social media, which shows a policeman with a sanitiser bottle placed in his holster instead of a gun.Police say criminals are also wary of Covid-19 and have suddenly gone incognito. Last week, the video of a group of alleged gangster inside Tihar was widely circulated in social media, in which they are heard complaining about cleanliness inside the prison. The prisoners were heard talking about how scared they were of Covid-19. While Delhi’s criminals seem to be homebound in this lockdown period, police personnel across the city are now working to feed the hungry and the homeless. The police helpline – 011 23469526—for Covid-19 requests has received 474 calls from people who said they were starving and had no money.The police control room vans, which are the first respondents to crime, are also doubling up as ambulances. Since March 23, the police vehicles have rushed at least 143 pregnant women to hospital. Additional commissioner of police MS Randhawa, who is the police’s spokesperson, admitted that incidence of crime had come down drastically. The officer said police are focusing on feeding the hungry and transporting people to hospital.“Our officers are on the roads across the city to ensure the lockdown. Crimes have definitely come down. At every police station, our officers are working to feed the hungry citizens. Our officers have tied up with NGOs and Good Samaritans and are feeding the underprivileged every day. We will also ensure that the low crime rate remains the same in the days to come,” he said.",23	32	32	-1,1	0	0	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/23-yr-old-held-for-dwarka-property-dealer-murder/story-lzoiwvWo5L0XKQxS7lAHNJ.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-two-assailants-identified-in-rohini-murder-case/articleshow/74229880.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-assailants-identified-in-rohini-murder-case-120022001175_1.html	https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-14-robberies-as-delhi-s-crime-rate-dips-in-lockdown/story-Cg0rWWQfknuNc9wG7N14zI.html,77

He is still on the run.Meanwhile, the police apprehended two other suspects, one of whom is allegedly a minor.Amit Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said that the suspects have claimed that the other gun used in the robbery was a “toy.”“A mobile phone recovered from one of the suspects has photographs of the weapons used in the robbery. The image suggests that it was a toy, but we will know for sure only when we nab the fourth suspect and recover the weapon,” said DCP Sharma.In March, an air pistol was used to nearly pull off a ₹40 lakh heist at a bank in outer Delhi’s Prashant Vihar, before the branch manager fought and overpowered the robber.In Thursday’s robbery, DCP Sharma said that the gang of four had “randomly” chosen the bank in Farsh Bazar, after travelling from their hometown in UP’s Amroha to the national Capital.“They had not conducted any reconnaissance of the bank. Their intention was to land in Delhi, rob someone or some establishment and then flee to their hometown,” the DCP said.While one suspect waited in an auto-rickshaw outside the bank, two others masked themselves using helmets and barged into the bank. They took ₹8.9 lakh belonging to two customers, who were depositing them at a counter, police said.The fourth suspect, claiming to be a minor, had allegedly provided logistical support to the suspects, an investigator said.

They lived in a small village called Tapukara near Alwar Rajasthan . After a few weeks, Shakuntala said yes to Singla’s proposal.However, their relationship didn’t go unnoticed for long as they were spotted by relatives while meeting in parks. This was in the autumn of 2010. As both were from different castes, their families were furious with the affair. Shakuntala’s family hurriedly searched for a groom and fixed her marriage.Singla, a transporter, was heartbroken. Shakuntala offered to elope, but Singla knew that would not work and they would be caught.Over the next few months, Singla extensively surfed the internet and watched movies and soap operas to zero in on a plan. On one weekend, he watched two movies — Humraaz and Helen of Troy — and instantly got inspired with the plots. He roped in his driver, Ganesh, by offering Rs 70,000 to carry out his plan.He then asked Shakuntala to get married to the man chosen by her family, but not develop physical relations with him. The plan was to execute a perfect murder so that they could live happily ever after.On February 8, Shakuntala got married to Ravi, a resident of Kapashera in southwest Delhi. As per the plan, she returned to her village just a day after marriage.In the next two weeks, Shakuntala, Singla and Ganesh finalised every minute detail of their plan and also did a dry run to make sure nothing went wrong. Shakuntala then reached Delhi on March 21, 2011. She stayed at her husband’s house, but told him that she had taken a vow not to get intimate with him for the goodwill of their marriage.The next day, the couple went for their first outing. The plan was to watch a movie and visit a relative. Ganesh passed by and Shakuntala stopped him for a ride. After a few minutes, Singla joined them and they drove past Samalakha.On the way, Singla revealed that he was Shakuntala’s old friend from their village. They dropped off Shakuntala at a relative’s place. Singla then asked Ravi to accompany him as he wanted to talk in private. After reaching a secluded spot, Singla and Ganesh strangled Ravi with a rope. They took the body to Tapukara and buried it. This spot was near Singla’s warehouse where he stored construction material.Meanwhile, when Ravi didn’t return, his father approached Kapashera police station. When Shakuntala was quizzed, she told police that Ravi had left her outside their relative’s house saying he would return in five minutes, but never did. After a month, on April 16, an FIR of abduction was lodged when police failed to get leads in the case. However, the family approached court and filed a Habeas Corpus writ. In October 2011, the case was transferred to Delhi Police’s Crime Branch For the next eight years, police got various leads that pointed towards the involvement of Shakuntala and her lover, but they couldn’t move ahead because of lack of evidence. Finally, a team led by deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Joy Tirkey tracked down Kamal and Ganesh. Shakuntala is still absconding.On Saturday morning, an earthmover was used in the presence of Tizara tehsil sub-divisional magistrate and Tapukara SHO to dig up 5-6 feet of the ground from which 25 bones of Ravi’s body were recovered.	Two men were arrested on Monday after the crime branch solved a nine-year-old case in which the accused kidnapped victim from Kapashera in Delhi, police said.

The deceased identified as Ravi was kidnapped in 2011.

The accused Kamal Singla along with his associate Ganesh had planned the entire plot of murder. They were arrested after police scrutinised the call details of the deceased's wife.

Singla murdered 22-year-old Ravi as he got married to his lover Shakuntala.

According to police, during the interrogation, Kamal revealed the planning of murder and accepted that he strangled Ravi at his farmhouse and took the corpse to Alwar in Rajasthan to bury it in a deep pit at a construction site. He also revealed that he promised Rs 70,000 to his associate to help him in the murder.

Learning about the development in the murder case, the main accused suspected that he might be arrested so he dugout Ravi's grave to destroy the remains.

Police are looking for Shakuntla who is missing for the past two years.Pieces of Ravi's 25 bones have been recovered and sent for DNA testing.	AHMEDABAD: It was a cold case that haunted the Delhi cops for eight years before it got cracked earlier this month – with cops arresting two of the primary suspects and finding bones of the murder victim within a fortnight.Ravi Kumar, a resident of Samalkha near Delhi, was reported missing by his father with Kapashera police station on March 23, 2011. A day earlier, Ravi had gone out with his wife Shakuntala to meet her sister. On the way, Ravi reportedly met someone and went in a car and was never seen again. An FIR was filed by Ravi’s father and a habeas corpus was also admitted to Delhi High Court.While Delhi cops had suspicion on Shakuntala, with whom Ravi had got married on February 8, and her alleged lover Kamal Singla, they could not find any clinching evidence against them. A lie-detection test on Shakuntala, Singla and Shakuntala’s brother Raju – who was under scanner as Singla had claimed to have met him on the day of the incident – in 2012 did not yield any conclusive result.Over next five years, the cat and mouse game continued between cops and perpetrators as fate of Ravi was uncertain. The suspects refused to undergo narco test, but Delhi police’s crime branch sought permission to perform brain electrical oscillation signature (BEOS) profiling for Singla and Raju. The test doesn’t require suspects to speak anything – the electrodes in a special cap attached to the skull record the brain activity to understand whether the person has experiential knowledge of the incident in question.",-1	9	-1,0	0	0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-perfect-murder-almost-case-solved-8-years-after-mans-wife-lover-killed-him/articleshow/71484617.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/delhi-9-yr-old-murder-case-solved-by-crime-branch-2-held-119100800138_1.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/his-mind-confesses-to-eight-year-old-cold-murder/articleshow/71587827.cms,83

Her father is employed at a factory in the locality. The apprehended boy who claims to be a minor lived in their building itself. The police, however, suspect he is an adult. “We are getting his age determined,” the DCP said.The suspect works at a printing press in west Delhi.The suspect allegedly befriended the girl and raped her, leaving her pregnant. “When her parents got to know of the boy befriending their daughter, they confronted and forced him to relocate. He eventually moved to Rajouri Garden,” said another investigator, who asked not to be named.“Her pregnancy was terminated recently. That led to complications, and her condition deteriorated. On Friday evening, her parents brought her to DDU Hospital in a serious condition. She died on Saturday morning, after which doctors alerted us around 9.30am,” Purohit said.The suspect was identified after the police started questioning people who knew the girl. He was subsequently apprehended and booked. The police continue to probe the circumstances of the termination of the pregnancy which led to her death. However, they are yet to determine whether it took place at a hospital, or elsewhere.	Image used for representational purpose only

They stole an SUV from Naraina, uprooted an ATM of a government bank, put it in the vehicle and sped away. It took the robbers barely 7-10 minutes to steal the car and uproot the ATM, which had Rs 20 lakh in it.What they didn’t realise that the vehicle was fitted with a GPS device. When the owner was informed that his SUV had been stolen, he remotely switched off the engine. The puzzled thieves tried every trick in the book to switch on the ignition, but failed. They then abandoned the vehicle in RK Puram and fled.Harmender Singh (61), a transporter who lives in Rajouri Garden, was informed by his security guard that his white Bolero had been stolen from outside his office in Naraina. He told TOI, “I got the call around 2.20am. My son and I switched on the GPS and the vehicle was seen going towards Mayapuri. We informed police and told them we were going to follow the SUV.”The SUV was found going towards Delhi Cantonment from where it turned towards Dhaula Kuan. “When we started, we were 12 minutes away from my vehicle. By the time we crossed Moti Bagh, the time difference was just eight minutes. My employees then remotely switched off the SUV’s engine. We found it abandoned in Sector 13 RK Puram.”The father-son duo didn’t find anyone near the SUV. “We soon spotted something inside the boot. I called my driver to ask if he had kept anything there, but he replied in the negative. We then found the ATM along with ropes and spray paint. Soon, police reached and took over,” said Singh.In the meanwhile, police were informed that an ATM near a guesthouse in Naraina had been stolen. A guesthouse employee told police that when they stepped out after hearing noises, the robbers threatened to fire at them. “A case has been registered and teams have been formed to nab the accused,” said DCP (West) Deepak Purohit.",15	-1,0	0,https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minor-pregnant-after-rape-dies-after-foetus-illegally-terminated-one-held/story-J49n9wiIUzvphXimKgtmWL.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gps-to-rescue-atm-robbers-locked-out-of-stolen-suv/articleshow/74199599.cms,89

NEW DELHI: The arrest of four people, including two mobile snatchers, on Tuesday solved the murder of a transporter’s employee in Rohini last week. The employee was found dead with stab wounds near Madhuban Chowk. 

After a police investigation, it was found the men who had snatched the phone had sold it to a receiver of stolen goods. The mastermind is said to be a juvenile, who was also nabbed on Monday. 

The murder came to light last Tuesday when cops at the Mangolpuri police station were informed about an unidentified body lying in the bushes. When cops reached the scene, they found a man with stab wounds on his chest and abdomen. Later, the victim was identified as Sudhir Dabas, a resident of Mangolpur Kalan village. 

 

The police probe also revealed that Sudhir, who worked for a transporter, was on his way back from work when he was killed. The family members reported that his mobile was missing from his personal belongings. 

“A police team formed to track down the killers found that his mobile phone was switched on by someone nearby. The person was tracked down and arrested,” said DCP (outer Delhi) A Koan. On being questioned, Raja Prasad said he had bought the phone from one Arpit. Based on his inputs, Arpit, too, was arrested from Mangolpuri. During his interrogation, Arpit admitted that he was aware of the phone belonging to a murder victim. He revealed that a juvenile and his friend, identified as Harish, had sold the mobile to him. The duo were tracked down and caught near Madhuban Chowk. While Harish was taken into custody, the juvenile was sent to a reforms home. 

When questioned, Harish told cops that he and the juvenile were consuming drugs near Madhuban Chowk when they saw the victim. They followed him until they reached a secluded spot where they held him at knifepoint and asked him to hand over his belongings. When he tried to resist, the duo attacked him with the knife. When he fell bleeding, they took his phone and fled. The phone was sold for Rs 1,500 to Arpit with which the duo bought drugs. Harish claimed it was the juvenile’s plan to rob the victim. Efforts are on to nab the rest of the gang members.",-1	-1,0	0,https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/new-delhi-crime-branch-arrests-three-men-for-plotting-murder-119101400063_1.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/arrest-of-snatchers-solves-rohini-murder-case/articleshow/72031258.cms,89

Instructions are also being issued by Police Headquarters to check crime in the state. Also, action is being given to the culprits and rewards are given to those who do good work.

Despite this, the recent incidents of loot in the state have raised questions on crime control. During the last 8 months, there have been 359 big and small incidents of loot in Jharkhand. These figures are from the Jharkhand Police, which are from January to August.

Police is not afraid of criminals
There has been an increase in crime across the state. Police is also continuously trying to reach the criminals. But on most occasions she is failing. If we talk about the incidents of loot and robbery, then despite the efforts of the police, criminals are constantly making people their victims. Police fear is less visible among criminals. Every day there is a loot incident somewhere. The robbers have killed the police.

Police has failed to identify gangs
The police has failed to identify the gang of criminals involved in the robbery. Because of which criminals are not caught after one or two incidents. Many other state gangs are also active in the state, who after fleeing the robbery incident migrate to another state. Due to which the police are also facing difficulty in catching the criminals of other states.

Banks and ATMs targeted by criminals
If you look at the recent months, the target of criminals in Jharkhand has been mainly banks and ATMs. Where criminals are carrying out the robbery in broad daylight. So on the other hand, the ATM is being stolen by breaking the ATM. Bank and ATMs at Ramgarh, Hazaribagh, Palamu, Dhanbad, Deoghar, Chatra and Ranchi have been targeted by criminals for robbery and theft.

Those arrested were identified as Sheikh Saifuddin (25), Wasim Akram (24) and Anwar (35), all residents of Jahangir Puri, and Mumtaz (25), a resident of Bhalswa.

The matter came to light after an incident of burglary in Pushp Vihar was reported at Saket police station, police said.

During investigation, it was found that similar type of burglaries were being carried out in nearby colonies over the past few days, they said.

Based on a tip-off, police laid a trap in Mayur Vihar Extension last week and intercepted their vehicle, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said.

But when signalled to stop, the accused opened fire at police personnel and tried to flee, he said, adding that the four men were arrested after a brief exchange of fire.

""The accused confessed of committing several burglaries in Pushp Vihar, Lodhi Colony and nearby areas. They would usually enter the colony in the afternoon and break into the houses that were vacant,"" the DCP said.

The four men also disclosed the name of a person who they used to sell the stolen articles, police said, adding that efforts were being made to nab him.

A car, one country-made pistol along with two live cartridges, two cutters and a screw driver were seized from their possession, police said.	Two sisters from Madhya Pradesh were arrested on Saturday for allegedly stealing Rs one lakh in two separate incidents in South Delhi, police said.

Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said the sisters used to visit the Delhi-NCR region and other states during festive and wedding season in search of targets.

They used to mainly focus on banks, ATM kiosks, shops, busy markets and crowded areas.

The incident came to light around 6am when a passerby noticed a gunny bag with bloodstains and alerted police. Police suspect Santosh might have been strangled and stabbed while he was sleeping as there was no sign of struggle.Preliminary probe revealed Santosh was accused no. 2 in a gang-rape case registered a few years ago by Rajagopalanagar police and accused of raping a minor and acquitted, following which he married the girl last year.Sources said Santosh was a fan of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and his family. He had a tattoo of Gowda on the right side of his chest and HD Kumaraswamy on the left.	GhaziabadA day after Gulshan Vasudeva and his family were found dead in an Indirapuram high-rise campus, police on Wednesday arrested his brother-in-law on charges of abetment to suicide. Rakesh Verma was arrested following an FIR lodged by Vasudeva’s brother Devendra Vasudeva.A suicide note found in the flat held Verma responsible too, said police.Verma, however, denied that he owed Vasudeva any money.According to police, Vasudeva had allegedly invested around Rs 1 crore in Verma’s business but the latter failed to return the money that led to pushing Vasudeva into a financial crisis.On Tuesday early morning, Vasudeva (45) and his wife Parveen(43), who together ran a garments business, allegedly jumped from their eighth floor flat in Krishna Apra Sapphire apartments after killing their teenage children. Their employee Sanjana (26) also jumped with them. She died in hospital.According to police theory, Vasudeva and his wife operated two businesses related to jeans and garments for children at Gandhi Nagar in Delhi and were facing financial crisis as a result of cheating allegedly committed by Verma in 2015.“Verma lured Vasudeva to invest Rs 1.09 crore property business. Later, Vasudeva took money from his acquaintances and also close friend Praveen Bakshi and gave it to Verma. Verma paid back the money through several cheques, which bounced,” said Sudhir Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP).“As a result of the financial issues, the family took the extreme step of taking their lives. Verma told us that he had not been in touch with Vasudeva for the last over one and half years, and not even on the day of the incident. He also told us that he returned about Rs 98 lakh, but Vasudeva was asking for a total amount of Rs 1.39 crore, which included 5% interest amount also,” SSP added.Vasudeva’s friend Bakshi had got two FIRs lodged against Verma and his mother Phoola Verma in 2015 for criminal breach of trust and cheating at Sahibabad police station. Both had been jailed for 28 days.Verma is a resident of Shalimar Graden Extn I in Ghaziabad.Before ending their lives Vasudeva had also made a video call to his friend 70-year-old Rakesh Arora, a resident of Jhilmil in East Delhi, and showed him his two dead children as well as the suicide note scribbled on the wall.“These are money for our last rites... We five have a last wish that our bodies should be cremated together. The person responsible for our death is this... Rakesh Verma,” the note scribble on the wall read.Verma denied all charges. “I had no communication with him on any matter ever since. I am saddened by the incident, especially the death of the two children. I have paid back all his money and whatever is to be told will be told before the court,” he said.	A Delhi court is likely to pronounce on Thursday its order on the quantum of sentence against two men convicted for raping a five-year-old girl in east Delhi in 2013.

The court had on January 18 convicted Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar.

In the gruesome incident at Gandhi Nagar on April 15, 2013, the convicts had shoved objects in the victim's private parts and abandoned her in a room, believing she was dead. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17.

In an over 100-page judgment, Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra had said: ""In our society, minor girls are worshipped as a goddess on certain occasions, but in the present case, the victim child, who was aged about five years at time of incident, had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality."" 



""The crime against the victim was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,"" the court had said.

The incident took place four months after the gangrape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya.

The court had convicted Shah and Kumar under sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376 (2) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.

Shah and Kumar were arrested from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar on April 20 and April 22 in 2013, respectively.

The police had said some foreign materials -- three pieces of a candle and one hair oil bottle -- were taken out from the body of the victim, which was also proved by doctors during recording of their statements in the court.

The girl had undergone multiple surgeries at the AIIMS in Delhi.

Anger over the incident had spilled onto Delhi's streets as outraged students and women staged demonstrations at the India Gate, police headquarters and near the residences of then prime minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Singh had said a collective effort was needed to root out such ""depravity"" from society.

The trial saw an interesting turn in 2014 when Kumar had moved the court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest.

The trial court took three years to decide his application of juvenility and transferred the case in April 2017 to the Juvenile Justice Board, which granted him bail in June.

Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved the Delhi High Court against the trial court's order declaring Pradeep to be a juvenile. The high court had in 2018 declared that Pradeep was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.	Two men accused of rape were arrested after a long hunt from Pulwama and Reasi districts of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, police said.

Joginder Singh was held from his village in Tral area of Pulwama district by a party from Gangyal police station, a police official said.

He said Singh was wanted in an abduction and rape case registered at the police station in 2002.

Another team from police post Digiana arrested the other rape accused Bashir Ahmad from Mahore area of Reasi district, the official said, adding a rape case was registered against him in Gandhi Nagar police station in 2018.",33	70	5	-1,0	0	0	0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gang-rape-accused-found-murdered-near-laggere/articleshow/72077743.cms	https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-murder-and-suicide-case-police-arrests-victim-s-brother-in-law-for-abetting-suicide-two-firs-lodged/story-SvugBnbtR9JcVzVhTTBKRP.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/quantum-of-sentence-in-2013-rape-case-of-5-yr-old-likely-tomorrow-120012901712_1.html	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/two-rape-accused-held-in-j-k-after-long-hunt-120021001252_1.html,77

NEW DELHI: This is one burglary in which the key to success was locked, quite literally. Buoyed by their success in stealing an ATM in south Delhi on Friday, a gang dared to strike again on Sunday night. They stole an SUV from Naraina, uprooted an ATM of a government bank, put it in the vehicle and sped away. It took the robbers barely 7-10 minutes to steal the car and uproot the ATM, which had Rs 20 lakh in it.What they didn’t realise that the vehicle was fitted with a GPS device. When the owner was informed that his SUV had been stolen, he remotely switched off the engine. The puzzled thieves tried every trick in the book to switch on the ignition, but failed. They then abandoned the vehicle in RK Puram and fled.Harmender Singh (61), a transporter who lives in Rajouri Garden, was informed by his security guard that his white Bolero had been stolen from outside his office in Naraina. He told TOI, “I got the call around 2.20am. My son and I switched on the GPS and the vehicle was seen going towards Mayapuri. We informed police and told them we were going to follow the SUV.”The SUV was found going towards Delhi Cantonment from where it turned towards Dhaula Kuan. “When we started, we were 12 minutes away from my vehicle. By the time we crossed Moti Bagh, the time difference was just eight minutes. My employees then remotely switched off the SUV’s engine. We found it abandoned in Sector 13 RK Puram.”The father-son duo didn’t find anyone near the SUV. “We soon spotted something inside the boot. I called my driver to ask if he had kept anything there, but he replied in the negative. We then found the ATM along with ropes and spray paint. Soon, police reached and took over,” said Singh.In the meanwhile, police were informed that an ATM near a guesthouse in Naraina had been stolen. A guesthouse employee told police that when they stepped out after hearing noises, the robbers threatened to fire at them. “A case has been registered and teams have been formed to nab the accused,” said DCP (West) Deepak Purohit.",18	-1	-1	-1,0	1	1	0,na	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/four-men-involved-in-over-30-cases-of-highway-robberies-arrested-from-dhaula-kuan-120020301173_1.html	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-four-men-involved-in-over-30-cases-of-highway-robberies-arrested-from-dhaula-kuan/articleshow/73904601.cms	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gps-to-rescue-atm-robbers-locked-out-of-stolen-suv/articleshow/74199599.cms,77

The HC, while acquitting person, said the state has been unable to prove the charges beyond “reasonable doubt”.A division bench of Justice Sahidullah Munshi and Justice Md Nizamuddin also turned down the state’s plea that the testimony of the survivor is enough to convict the accused. The HC in its detailed order said, “There is no doubt about this proposition of law but fact remains testimony of this victim should inspire confidence of the Court and to gain such confidence other circumstantial evidence on record have to be considered but simply of a victim saying that she has been subjected to physical violation someone cannot be penalized under the provisions of Section 376(2)(f) of IPC without commission of offence being proved beyond reasonable doubt.”	Bhagwanpur village of Yamunanagar has sealed its borders

The five arrested included two of the accused in the rape case.The victim suffered 90% burn injuries.The victim alleged that Shivam and Shubham Trivedi had abducted and raped her in December 2018. However, the FIR was registered in March.	A Delhi court is likely to pronounce on Thursday its order on the quantum of sentence against two men convicted for raping a five-year-old girl in east Delhi in 2013.

The court had on January 18 convicted Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar.

In the gruesome incident at Gandhi Nagar on April 15, 2013, the convicts had shoved objects in the victim's private parts and abandoned her in a room, believing she was dead. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17.

In an over 100-page judgment, Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra had said: ""In our society, minor girls are worshipped as a goddess on certain occasions, but in the present case, the victim child, who was aged about five years at time of incident, had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality."" 



""The crime against the victim was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,"" the court had said.

The incident took place four months after the gangrape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya.

The court had convicted Shah and Kumar under sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376 (2) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.

Shah and Kumar were arrested from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar on April 20 and April 22 in 2013, respectively.

The police had said some foreign materials -- three pieces of a candle and one hair oil bottle -- were taken out from the body of the victim, which was also proved by doctors during recording of their statements in the court.

The girl had undergone multiple surgeries at the AIIMS in Delhi.

Anger over the incident had spilled onto Delhi's streets as outraged students and women staged demonstrations at the India Gate, police headquarters and near the residences of then prime minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Singh had said a collective effort was needed to root out such ""depravity"" from society.

The trial saw an interesting turn in 2014 when Kumar had moved the court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest.

The trial court took three years to decide his application of juvenility and transferred the case in April 2017 to the Juvenile Justice Board, which granted him bail in June.

Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved the Delhi High Court against the trial court's order declaring Pradeep to be a juvenile. The high court had in 2018 declared that Pradeep was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.",-1	5,0	0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unnao-rape-victims-death-key-developments/articleshow/72412517.cms	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/quantum-of-sentence-in-2013-rape-case-of-5-yr-old-likely-tomorrow-120012901712_1.html,89

""The victim had met ASP on Tuesday and claimed she was threatened with a 'Unnao like' fate if she did not compromise with the accused,"" said Jafarganj Circle Officer Shripal Yadav.

""We are probing the matter. If it is proved that the victim was threatened, a fresh case will be registered against the accused,"" he added.

The teenaged girl was allegedly abducted and raped by four men last month in a village in Ghazipur near here. After registering the FIR at the Ghazipur police station, police arrested the main accused Pradeep, but three others are still absconding.

""We are trying to arrest the remaining three. Searches are on to nab them,"" the circle officer added.

The gang-rape victim alleged that all the four accused belong to her village and their family members are threatening her.

A 23-year-old rape victim from Unnao was allegedly set on fire on Dec 5 by five men, including the two who were accused of raping her, while she was on her way to attend the court hearing.

The victim died the next day during treatment at Safdarjunj Hospital in New Delhi. All five men, who set the victim ablaze, were arrested soon after they committed the crime.	Ghazipur, Feb. 15 -- Three people were arrested in a double-murder case of two brothers, which took place on February 9 in Nandganj area of this Uttar Pradesh district, police said here on Saturday.
Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Singh said here that Vijay, resident of Nandganj area and his brother Pradyuman were proceeding towards their home after closing the shop on February 9, when some people shot at Vijay. Upon resistance from Pradyuman, the miscreants opened fire at him as well.
The SP said that Kanhaiya alias Khulli, Piyush Bind and Ashwani have been arrested in connection with the case from old Kabaadi market. The pistol used in the murder has also been recovered.
During the interrogation, Kanhaiya said that during a dance on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti last year, he and Vijay had got involved in a scuffle after a dispute.
Kanhaiya had also burnt the small shop of the deceased. Vijay had then got Rs 65,000 as the recovery amount, instead of Rs 5,000 through the Panchayat.
Kanhaiya also said that despite this, Vijay had threatened to implicate him in a false case. Enraged over this, he devised a plan for revenge and included Ashwini and Piyush in it.
The SP has announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for the police team, which solved the case.

They may be worse than what happened in Unnao,” the note read.Even during an earlier court hearing, the accused had harassed the survivor so much that she had to be admitted to a Delhi hospital and could not make it to the court, her father said.Acting swiftly, the local police filed an FIR and arrested the accused on Thursday.Baghpat superintendent of police Gopendra Yadav said, “We arrested Soran Singh , 30, during the early hours of Thursday on the basis of the complaint made by the survivor’s father. He has been charged with criminal intimidation.”According to police, the survivor used to stay with her father, a taxi driver, in Delhi’s Burari area for coaching in 2018 when she came in contact with Singh, who belonged to her village in Baghpat.In July 2018, Singh took her to a vacant flat in Mukherjee Nagar on the pretext of providing her with notes for her studies, spiked her drink and allegedly raped her. He also filmed the act and began to blackmail her into submission. Unable to continue with repeated sexual abuse, she filed a police complaint in Delhi.Singh was booked under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison with an intent to commit offence). According to the FIR and chargesheet, Soran was arrested on July 11, 2018 but was released on bail on July 30 the same year. Ever since, Soran had been pressuring the family for a compromise.“My daughter is terrified as the accused continues to haunt our family. He has accosted me many a time and even threatened my daughter when she had gone to appear in her exams in a local college. He hounded my daughter so badly the last time that she had to be admitted to Delhi’s St. Stephens Hospital because of trauma and could not make it to the court hearing,” the survivor’s father said.	A rape accused out on bail here allegedly warned the victim against deposing in the court or face consequences worse than the Unnao tragedy, in which a girl was burnt to death recently.

The accused allegedly on Tuesday pasted a warning outside the house of the 19-year-old victim, who was scheduled to give her statement in a court on Friday.

The note read if she testified in the court on Friday the consequences will be very bad or worse than Unnao"".

In a shock, the girl's family informed police after which accused Soharan was arrested, Baghpat SP Pratap Gopendra said on Friday.

The SP said security had been stepped up around the victim's house and policemen would accompany her to the court in Delhi and bring her back.

The in-charge of the Badaut police station, R K Singh, quoting the complaint of the victim's father said the girl, who was taking coaching in Delhi, was allegedly gangraped by the youth and two others at his room in March 2018.

They had allegedly served her a cold drink laced with intoxicants.

They also made a video of the incident and raped her many times, threatening to upload it on social media, Singh said.

Fed up with the harassment, the girl informed her parents after which an FIR was lodged with the Mukherjee Nagar police in Delhi on July 9, 2018.

The case was being heard in a Rohini court in Delhi and the accused was out on bail, Singh said.

BJP MP Parvesh Verma on Tuesday raised the spectre of Shaheen Bagh's anti-CAA protesters in their lakhs entering homes to rape and kill women, provoking opposition outrage as the Delhi election chief submitted a report on his remarks to the Election Commission.

The West Delhi MP, who asserted in an election rally on Monday that the Shaheen Bagh protest site will be cleared in an hour on February 11 if his party comes to power, 



also said what happened in Kashmir with Kashmiri Pandits could happen in Delhi too.

Votes for the Delhi elections, being held on February 8, will be counted on February 11.

""What happened in Kashmir with Kashmiri Pandits could happen in Delhi also. Lakhs of people gather at Shaheen Bagh, they could enter houses rape and kill your sisters and daughters. The people need to decide now,"" Verma told PTI, controversial comments that attracted widespread attention.

He also told media persons there should be a probe on who was instigating people to protest against the CAA despite repeated clarifications by the government that no Indian citizen would lose citizenship due to the amended law.

Verma said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia had supported Shaheen Bagh protesters and it was now time for the people of the national capital to decide who they want to vote for on February 8.

Addressing an election rally in Janakpuri on Monday in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Verma spoke of vacating the Shaheen Bagh protest site on the night of February 11. He also reiterated that 40 mosques, graveyards and 'mazars' illegally constructed on government land in his constituency would be cleared within if the BJP wins the elections.

Verma made the same statement at a press conference earlier this month, but put the figure of the illegal constructions at around 50.

The Delhi Chief Electoral Officer sent a report to the Election Commission on Verma's ""provocative statements"".

Sources in the poll panel said BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur and Verma are likely to be issued show cause notices by the Election Commission soon for their controversial remarks. They said the EC had examined the reports sent by the Delhi CEO Office, and is of the view that the show cause notices should be issued to the two party leaders.

Thakur had egged on the crowd at a rally on Monday to raise an incendiary slogan -- ""traitors should be shot at"" -- after he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra and his party colleague Ajay Maken filed complaints against Thakur and Verma with the Election Commission.

Noida: Days after a jeweller was shot at by three robbers who barged into his shop in broad daylight and fled with a tray of gold, Noida police have failed to make any arrests in the case. The investigation, too, has not made much headway as the number plates on the two bikes used in the crime — Honda Shine and Hero Splendor — were fake.According to police sources, the registration number of the Honda Shine was found to be a fake on the day of the crime itself while the number plate on the other bike showed it was registered in the name of a Ghaziabad resident. However, when a police team reached his home, it was revealed that the number had been allocated earlier to a scooter.Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, said they were trying to find out if gangs from Delhi were involved in the robbery.“The CCTV footage of the road that the robbers took have shown their location up to Dharamshila Hospital in Vasundhara Enclave area in Delhi.

We are gathering information on such gangs,” he said.Police have also not ruled out the possibility of personal enmity behind the robbery. “We are conducting raids in several areas of Delhi that share their borders with Noida. As of now, we are exploring both angles despite the fact that the victim has in his statement denied of any personal enmity,” said Sankalp Sharma, DCP (zone 1).Naresh Panwar was shot at in the head and stabbed in the back on Thursday inside his shop at P block market in Sector 12.

Karkardooma,2020-03-05	2020-03-05	2020-03-09,Business Standard	Hindustan Times	Times of India,"Expelled AAP Councillor accused in IB officer's murder arrested	Tahir Hussain, suspect in IB staffer’s murder arrested, toll in Delhi riots rises to 53	Ankit Sharma murder: Delhi Police searching for Tahir Hussain's brother | Delhi News - Times of India",murder	murder	murder,"Expelled Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Councillor Tahir Hussain, who is an accused in the murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma during the violence in north-east Delhi, was on Thursday arrested by the police following the rejection of his surrender application.

""We are taking appropriate legal action against Tahir Hussain. We will soon present him before the law,"" Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava told reporters after the arrest.

Delhi Police is likely to produce Hussain in the Karkardooma court to seek remand.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Vishal Pahuja dismissed the surrender application filed by advocates Mukesh Kalia and Javed Ali on behalf of Tahir Hussain.

In his surrender application, Hussain sought to join the investigation in the matter and protection to life and property.

Meanwhile, a Delhi court had on Wednesday deferred the hearing on the anticipatory bail plea of Hussain, who was earlier absconding, in the FIR lodged against him in the alleged killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma.

Sharma's body was recovered from a drain in Chand Bagh on February 26 during the violence in north-east Delhi.

At least 47 people lost their lives and more than 200 people sustained serious injuries in the communal violence that raged for four days in north-east Delhi last week.	The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain from a Delhi court where he had come to surrender, ending an eight-day-long search launched after he was booked for murder and abduction of Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer Ankit Sharma in Chand Bagh during communal riots in northeast Delhi last week. The special investigation teams (SITs) probing the riots cases took Hussain into custody after the Rouse Avenue court dismissed his plea, seeking to surrender before it by saying that the relief sought by him was outside the court’s jurisdiction. The court said that as per the provisions of 177 Criminal Procedure Code (Ordinary place of inquiry and trial), the offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by court within whose local jurisdiction it is committed.“In the instant case, the offence has been committed within the jurisdiction of PS Dayalpur, which falls within the jurisdiction of Karkardooma Court. The reason given in the application for moving this application does not justify the conduct of the applicant to choose this forum for seeking the reliefs,” the judge said. The Karkardooma Court, where Hussain’s anticipatory bail application was moved on Wednesday, also rejected the request on Thursday, observing that nobody had appeared from his side. The court had on Wednesday issued notice to the police on the anticipatory bail plea and kept it for hearing on Thursday.Before being caught, Hussain had given an interview to India Today in which he claimed to be “innocent” and alleged that he was being framed as part of “some conspiracy”. Hussain said he was ready to undergo a “narco-analysis (test)” and cooperate the police in their probe. He said he has faith in police and the judiciary and that the police would do a “fair investigation”. The police officials took Hussain to the crime branch’s office in Sunlight Colony where he is being interrogated in connection with IB officer’s murder case and two more cases of alleged firing, pelting of stones and petrol bombs from his Chand Bagh house on February 24 and 25. A man named Ajay Goswami, the complainant in the attempt to murder case, had sustained a bullet injury in his back during the firing. “We have arrested Hussain and are interrogating him to ascertain his role and the exact sequence of events leading to the murder of the IB staffer, whose body with multiple stab wounds was recovered from a drain in Chand Bagh on February 26,” said a senior crime branch officer. Another officer associated with the SITs said Hussain’s interrogation will be videographed. “Investigators will confront him with the videos of violence from his house and the presence of petrol bombs, empty bottles, sticks and other incriminating materials that were recovered by the police and forensic team,” the officer said. Special commissioner of police (crime and intelligence) Praveer Ranjan said Hussain will be produced in the city court on Friday.On Thursday afternoon, Advocate Mukesh Kalia, appearing for Hussain, submitted that there is a grave apprehension of threat to his life and therefore he has not surrendered before competent court as there is “charged environment” in Karkardooma District court. He said Hussain has no connection or involvement in the FIR registered by the police and he is being falsely implicated.Considering the gravity of the situation, Hussain wishes to surrender before the court, he said.The court said the Delhi High Court has specifically made a division of the jurisdictions, be that of the police stations or the courts district-wise and work has been allocated accordingly.It said: “This court is a special designated court dealing with the matters of MPs/MLAs. The high court has designated this court as special court to deal with cases on fast track with endeavour to dispose of the same within one year as its objective.“The applicant does not fall in the aforesaid category, hence this application cannot be even entertained by this court.” The court further said that the relief sought by Hussain does not fall within the domain or jurisdiction of this court, “hence, no such relief can be granted. In view of the observations, the application deserves to be dismissed”.As the court dismissed Hussain’s plea, a Delhi Police team, which had already arrived, arrested him and took him into custody.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had suspended Hussain soon after the case of murder in the IB staffer’s death was registered and he was allegedly linked to it. Police registered 701 cases, including 47 under the Arms Act, till Thursday in connection with the last week’s communal violence, which had so far claimed 53 lives and left over 400 others injured.

Sunlight Colony,2020-03-05,Hindustan Times,"Tahir Hussain, suspect in IB staffer’s murder arrested, toll in Delhi riots rises to 53",murder,"The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain from a Delhi court where he had come to surrender, ending an eight-day-long search launched after he was booked for murder and abduction of Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer Ankit Sharma in Chand Bagh during communal riots in northeast Delhi last week. The special investigation teams (SITs) probing the riots cases took Hussain into custody after the Rouse Avenue court dismissed his plea, seeking to surrender before it by saying that the relief sought by him was outside the court’s jurisdiction. The court said that as per the provisions of 177 Criminal Procedure Code (Ordinary place of inquiry and trial), the offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by court within whose local jurisdiction it is committed.“In the instant case, the offence has been committed within the jurisdiction of PS Dayalpur, which falls within the jurisdiction of Karkardooma Court. The reason given in the application for moving this application does not justify the conduct of the applicant to choose this forum for seeking the reliefs,” the judge said. The Karkardooma Court, where Hussain’s anticipatory bail application was moved on Wednesday, also rejected the request on Thursday, observing that nobody had appeared from his side. The court had on Wednesday issued notice to the police on the anticipatory bail plea and kept it for hearing on Thursday.Before being caught, Hussain had given an interview to India Today in which he claimed to be “innocent” and alleged that he was being framed as part of “some conspiracy”. Hussain said he was ready to undergo a “narco-analysis (test)” and cooperate the police in their probe. He said he has faith in police and the judiciary and that the police would do a “fair investigation”. The police officials took Hussain to the crime branch’s office in Sunlight Colony where he is being interrogated in connection with IB officer’s murder case and two more cases of alleged firing, pelting of stones and petrol bombs from his Chand Bagh house on February 24 and 25. A man named Ajay Goswami, the complainant in the attempt to murder case, had sustained a bullet injury in his back during the firing. “We have arrested Hussain and are interrogating him to ascertain his role and the exact sequence of events leading to the murder of the IB staffer, whose body with multiple stab wounds was recovered from a drain in Chand Bagh on February 26,” said a senior crime branch officer. Another officer associated with the SITs said Hussain’s interrogation will be videographed. “Investigators will confront him with the videos of violence from his house and the presence of petrol bombs, empty bottles, sticks and other incriminating materials that were recovered by the police and forensic team,” the officer said. Special commissioner of police (crime and intelligence) Praveer Ranjan said Hussain will be produced in the city court on Friday.On Thursday afternoon, Advocate Mukesh Kalia, appearing for Hussain, submitted that there is a grave apprehension of threat to his life and therefore he has not surrendered before competent court as there is “charged environment” in Karkardooma District court. He said Hussain has no connection or involvement in the FIR registered by the police and he is being falsely implicated.Considering the gravity of the situation, Hussain wishes to surrender before the court, he said.The court said the Delhi High Court has specifically made a division of the jurisdictions, be that of the police stations or the courts district-wise and work has been allocated accordingly.It said: “This court is a special designated court dealing with the matters of MPs/MLAs. The high court has designated this court as special court to deal with cases on fast track with endeavour to dispose of the same within one year as its objective.“The applicant does not fall in the aforesaid category, hence this application cannot be even entertained by this court.” The court further said that the relief sought by Hussain does not fall within the domain or jurisdiction of this court, “hence, no such relief can be granted. In view of the observations, the application deserves to be dismissed”.As the court dismissed Hussain’s plea, a Delhi Police team, which had already arrived, arrested him and took him into custody.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had suspended Hussain soon after the case of murder in the IB staffer’s death was registered and he was allegedly linked to it. Police registered 701 cases, including 47 under the Arms Act, till Thursday in connection with the last week’s communal violence, which had so far claimed 53 lives and left over 400 others injured. A total of 1,820 people have either been arrested or detained so far.
